Strong undercurrent of malaise all day.\n\nVera::I would have written the same on days minus-14 to 0 if I started this earlier.\n\nVera::Getting \"promoted\" to the maternity ward.  What an infuriating euphemism.  The pay is the same, the work is even less important, and I'm surrounded by screaming newborns.  I hate children!  Famously!  Sending me here was a sick joke.\n\nVera::Perhaps if I'm as obnoxious in this position in the last, I can get \"promoted\" out of here yet again...\n\n[[p:(Action) Flip the page.->Page 2]]",

The accounting here is hellishly monotonous.  Do you have any clue how difficult it is to bore someone passionate about accounting? \n\nVera::Within the SATURN core I felt like I was actually making an impact at least.  I guess Rosalind was so \"thrilled\" I blew the whistle on the fraudulently produced safety test results that she decided I could make an even bigger impact here, making sure no screaming newborns double dip in the hospital account.\n\nVera::The only things of any import to keep track of are the medicine consumption tabulations and the infant sickness rates and correlations.  Sometimes more than one gets hepatitis, and there's a link.  Sometimes some fent fiend decides to dip into the medical supply closets.  Petty indiscrepancies.  It's not much but it's all I've got to work with.",
