You repeatedly muttered a few phrases, along the lines of &quot;I&#39;ve ruined everything for all eternity&quot;, or &quot;nothing can ever fix this&quot;, or &quot;none of this is my fault!&quot;  

Wiggly::You also said something about finding a time machine somewhere in the Cradle, fixing it up, and using it to undo everything unacceptable.  You said something along those lines, in different ways, three or four times actually.

[[That&#39;s not what I remember dreaming.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="That&#39;s not what I remember dreaming." tags="" position="1179,906" size="100,100">Wiggly::Well, it&#39;s what I remember you saying.

[[C-&gt;Hey, hey, I hear you.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="How long was I out for?" tags="" position="1050,760" size="100,100">Wiggly::Not long, maybe 30 minutes.  You went out pretty much immediately after you flung yourself into the ventillation shaft - it all happened pretty fast, but I think you might have hit your head or something.

Wiggly::I wasn&#39;t sure what was going on, so I closed up the grate and pulled you a few dozen meters to get you out of the shaft and into this more spacious basement.  I&#39;ve been looking over you since.

[[I didn&#39;t hit my head.  I was drugged.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Untitled Passage 1" tags="" position="1176,350" size="100,100">Miss?  Can you hear me?

Please, without motor or verbal feedback on your part, I have no way to know if you&#39;re alright.

[[Hey, hey, I hear you.]]
[[Settle down, I&#39;m fine.  I&#39;ve always been fine.  Why are you not fine?-&gt;Hey, hey, I hear you.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Hey, hey, I hear you." tags="" position="1175,530" size="100,100">The look of concern dissipates from his face, leaving only hints of exhasperation.

Wiggly::Thank goodness miss.  You really had me worried.

Wiggly::You weren&#39;t responding - I was worried I might have lost another client.

[[Why is my hair wet?]]
[[How long was I out for?]]
[[Did I say anything while I was out?]]
[[p:How did you know I needed to be rescued from that room?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="p:How did you know I needed to be rescued from that room?" tags="" position="1316,752" size="100,100">Wiggly::I didn&#39;t, miss.  But the way you were behaving, well, I could tell something unusual was going on.

Wiggly::I was in the overhead ventillation system in the hallway outside of that room, so I tried yelling through the vents, but you couldn&#39;t hear me.  You were only a few feet away.

Wiggly::I saw you enter that room, so I decided to follow the ventillation shafts there.  And when I opened that grate, you dived in.  You acted like you were trying to get away from something, so I closed up the grate and dragged you this basement.

[[p:What about the woman who drugged me, Julia?  What happened to her?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="p:What about the woman who drugged me, Julia?  What happened to her?" tags="" position="1316,902" size="100,100">For a brief moment, Wiggly&#39;s face looks perplexed.  This quickly gives way to a look of intense, focused concern.

Wiggly::Miss.  There wasn&#39;t anyone else with you.

Wiggly::Not in the hallway, and not in the room.

How could he have missed her?  She was right there.  He must have not been paying attention.

[[p:You must have missed her.  She was right behind me in the hallway, and tried restraining me in the room.]]
[[p:I must have taken a big blow to the head.  I remember a woman, who said her name was Julia, leading me to that room.-&gt;p:You must have missed her.  She was right behind me in the hallway, and tried restraining me in the room.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="p:You must have missed her.  She was right behind me in the hallway, and tried restraining me in the room." tags="" position="1316,1052" size="100,100">Wiggly&#39;s grave look of concern grows deeper, more pronounced.

Wiggly::I...see.  This is very bad, miss.  Very serious.

Wiggly::This &quot;Julia&quot; who&#39;s been following you - she&#39;s not like you or me.  She&#39;s a part of the Cradle.  And for whatever reason, she&#39;s attached to you.

[[How can someone be &quot;part of the Cradle&quot;?]]
[[Who is &quot;Julia,&quot; exactly?-&gt;How can someone be &quot;part of the Cradle&quot;?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="How can someone be &quot;part of the Cradle&quot;?" tags="" position="1252,1209" size="100,100">Wiggly::Not everyone left behind during the catastrophe was lucky enough to die.  An unfortunate few are still here.  Lingering on, nails dug deep into their palms, past their expiration.

Wiggly::&quot;Julia&quot; is one of them, I&#39;m sure.  The fact only you could see her confirms it.

Wiggly::You&#39;re in deep trouble, miss.

[[But I still don&#39;t understand how?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="But I still don&#39;t understand how?" tags="" position="1252,1359" size="100,100">Wiggly::Neither do we.  No one does.  

Wiggly::But nonetheless I&#39;ve seen this before.  So have the other Ferrymen.  A client, most often someone with connections here, enters the Cradle.  And then, usually somewhere near the SATURN Core, they start having delusions of a third party.

Wiggly::Their presence might be innocuous enough at first - helpful, even.  But soon they get sick.  Fall over.  Start having hallucinations.

Wiggly::No matter how many times I see it happen, it never fails to shake me to my core - seeing a client, incapacited, writhing in terror at someone in the room I cannot even see.

Wiggly::If we hadn&#39;t been separated I might have noticed the signs earlier.  Not that it would have helped much.

He&#39;s being uncharacteristically blunt, isn&#39;t he?  You&#39;re fucked.

[[You&#39;ve gone through this before - that means you know what to do?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="You&#39;ve gone through this before - that means you know what to do?" tags="" position="1252,1509" size="100,100">He is quiet for a moment, confirming your worst fears.

Wiggly::Well, we are not completely bereft of options miss.  But there is no way to run away from this.  Julia is attached to you.  You&#39;ll need to find a way to shake her off.

[[Your other clients - how did they get through it?]]
[[Give me the details, how do I shake her off?-&gt;Your other clients - how did they get through it?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Why is my hair wet?" tags="" position="916,760" size="100,100">Wiggly::Because I threw water on your face to wake you up.

[[Thanks.  I deserved it.-&gt;Hey, hey, I hear you.]] 
[[Please never do that again.  Just let me die.-&gt;Hey, hey, I hear you.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="I didn&#39;t hit my head.  I was drugged." tags="" position="1050,910" size="100,100">Wiggly::Hmm.  I don&#39;t see how that could have happened, but if you say so, miss.

[[C-&gt;Hey, hey, I hear you.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Your other clients - how did they get through it?" tags="" position="1248,1659" size="100,100">Wiggly::The client who got through found some old family photo belonging to her attachment.  I couldn&#39;t see exactly what happened, but she reported that showing the family photo to the entity haunting her allowed her to break free.

Wiggly::We should hunt for some sort of personal artifact that means something to Julia.  I think that&#39;s your best chance.

Wiggly::What can you tell me about Julia?  Any leads that might point us towards personal artifacts of hers?]]

[[&quot;Client&quot;?  As in, singular?]]
[[p:She&#39;s a nurse who works in the maternity ward.  She acted like the visitation she was bringing me in for was extremely discreet, and was very cagey about what it was actually for.  She had some sort of emotional reaction to the auditorium.  That&#39;s really all I know.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="&quot;Client&quot;?  As in, singular?" tags="" position="1142,1814" size="100,100">Wiggly::Yes.  I&#39;m not going to lie to you, miss.  I&#39;ve only had one client make it through something like this.  The rest either expired or disappeared.

&quot;Expired&quot; and &quot;disappeared&quot; are pretty thin euphemisms for &quot;died&quot; and &quot;had something even worse happen to them,&quot; respectively.

[[Good to know.-&gt;Your other clients - how did they get through it?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="p:She&#39;s a nurse who works in the maternity ward.

[[p:Yes.  She assumed that&#39;s what I was there for when I first encountered her.  I went along with it because the door to the maternity ward was locked, and she said she could bring me here.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="p:Yes.

That door shouldn&#39;t have been locked.  Kind of suspicious...

Wiggly::In any case, that&#39;s not a lot to work with, but it&#39;s a start.  It&#39;ll be high risk, but we should scour the maternity ward for anything we can find pertaining to Julia.  I doubt we&#39;ll find the personal artifacts we&#39;re looking for, but we might find a few clues as to her identity and exact role.

[[p:Alright.  I don&#39;t see any point in wasting time.]]
[[p:Seems like a long shot, but I don&#39;t have much other choice.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="p:Alright.  I don&#39;t see any point in wasting time." tags="" position="1249,2232" size="100,100">Wiggly::I agree.  The tunnels behind me are pretty much a straight shot.  They terminate at a hatch that leads up to one of the maternity ward offices.  I suggest we start heading through them.

Wiggly::Are you feeling stable, good to walk?  We can spend a few more minutes recovering here, but I wouldn&#39;t want to linger for long.

[[p:I&#39;m fine.  I actually feel better than before getting knocked out.]]
[[p:Trust me, I&#39;m not going to feel any better in a few minutes.-&gt;p:I&#39;m fine.

Wiggly::I&#39;ll be following you, miss.
