Her eyes appear slightly sunken, as if she was very behind on sleep.  She quickly rises from the pail to address you.

Frail Woman::Excuse me, mam, but how did you get past the front gate?

She leans in a little and begins to speak in a hushed tone.

Frail Woman::I know some of our services are more discreet in nature, but we still need to go through the proper channels and have you signed in.

[[p:I came in through the sewer.]]
[[p:(Lie) I did come in past the front gate.]]
[[p:How did *you* get through the front gate, huh?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="p:I came in through the sewer." tags="" position="995,753" size="100,100">Frail Woman::...

Frail Woman::Oh, you must mean The Keep.  It&#39;s hard to keep up with all the new colloquialisms floating around the Cradle.  

She seems to have interpreted &quot;the sewer&quot; as a figure of speech.  Odd, given that you likely reek, but you think it prudent not to press her on the matter.

[[Continue-&gt;Signed In]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="p:How did *you* get through the front gate, huh?" tags="" position="1332,757" size="100,100">Frail Woman::Ma&#39;am, I have a key.  All infirmary employees do.  

And you have to pass it to get here, so I&#39;m a little alarmed you made it past them without anyone noticing.  I&#39;ll have to have a few words with whoever is on shift about this oversight.

[[Continue-&gt;Signed In]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Signed In" tags="" position="1178,915" size="100,100">Frail Woman::In any case, we&#39;ve really got to get you signed in.  You should have been primed on how to enter discretely.  Follow me to the nurses station, we&#39;ll quietly get you recorded and we can move into the operations ward.

[[Sign in?  Have you seen this place?]]
[[p:Hold on, who are you?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Sign in?  Have you seen this place?" tags="" position="1103,1065" size="100,100">Frail Woman::You might have come in for an under the table operation, but we still need to go through the motions of signing you in and recording your visit.  Wouldn&#39;t it be odd if countless unaccompanied women came in and out at all hours with no proper documentation of their visits?

She thinks you&#39;re here for something seedy.  Something &quot;under the table,&quot; to borrow her parlance.  She&#39;s correct, though she&#39;s mistaken about the exact nature of your visit.

But it makes you wonder.  What does she think is going on?

[[Continue-&gt;Signed In]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="p:Hold on, who are you?" tags="" position="1253,1065" size="100,100">Dora::My name is Dora.  I&#39;ve been a midwife at this infirmary for 9 years.  You are in good hands.

Dora&#39;s presence is strange and unnatural.  The feeling is difficult to place, but her cadence and gestures seem disconnected from the present scene.  The sub-lingual signals she&#39;s sending you via gesticulations and body language are distorted and inscrutable, as if transmitted through a television set overcome with static.

[[Have you taken a look around recently?  This infirmary clearly hasn&#39;t been operational for a long time.]]
[[What kind of operation am I signing up for?]]
[[What do you do here?]]
[[p:If we go get &quot;signed in,&quot; will you take me to the records room?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Have you taken a look around recently?  This infirmary clearly hasn&#39;t been operational for a long time." tags="" position="1093,1223" size="100,100">Jane::That&#39;s ridiculous.

Her dismissal of the suggestion is visible.  She immediately twitches her head quickly to the left, physically signalling her rejection of the notion.  To Dora, the infirmary closing is inconcievable.

Jane::Look, we&#39;re doing the best we can in light of the recent expansion.  Our budget wasn&#39;t inflated enough to keep up.  I assure you though, you will still receive top notch care, both above and below board. 

Jane::Now let&#39;s go fill out your record.

An explosion in active patients doesn&#39;t seem to be the issue here.  But, she&#39;s eager to move on from this train of thought.  

[[Continue-&gt;p:Hold on, who are you?]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="What do you do here?" tags="" position="1371,1221" size="100,100">Jane::I&#39;m a midwife.  That&#39;s not exactly the technical title for my position, but that&#39;s what I am - I assist mothers through the process of birth.

Jane::But as you&#39;re aware, I&#39;ve also taken on a number of other responsibilities.

[[Continue-&gt;p:Hold on, who are you?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="What kind of operation am I signing up for?" tags="" position="1235,1223" size="100,100">Jane::Look, I expect you have some anxieties going into this, but we really cannot discuss them here.  We&#39;ll talk about it in private, later, after sign in.

She expects you to know, so you should probably just go along with it for now.  

[[Continue-&gt;p:Hold on, who are you?]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="p:(Lie) I did come in past the front gate." tags="" position="1176,760" size="100,100">Frail Woman::No, you didn&#39;t.  I would have gotten a few alert taps through the tele-alert system, and I would have prepared to meet you in the inspection room instead of here.  I don&#39;t typically introduce myself to patients while washing stained rags.

For what it&#39;s worth, the rags look pretty clean to you.  

[[Continue-&gt;Signed In]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="p:If we go get &quot;signed in,&quot; will you take me to the records room?" tags="" position="1514,1222" size="100,100">Jane::We will be going to the operations section of the infirmary complex, where most of our records are stored.  But most of the records are classified - I don&#39;t even have physical access to some of them.  What could you possibly want with them anyhow?

[[I need to find proof that I was born here.]]
[[This hospital has secrets.  I aim to figure them out, serial adventure boy detective style.]]
[[It&#39;s a personal matter.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="I need to find proof that I was born here." tags="" position="1364,1372" size="100,100">That&#39;s absurd.  This place has only been operational for 19 years.  I&#39;m sorry miss, but you look a little over that peak to me.

[[Continue-&gt;This will get me closer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="This hospital has secrets.  I aim to figure them out, serial adventure boy detective style." tags="" position="1514,1372" size="100,100">Jane::...Let&#39;s get you signed in.  I&#39;ll need to check your patient record but I suspect you might need a few refills, in addition to our other services.

&quot;Refills.&quot;  She means medication refills.  She&#39;s making fun of you.

[[Continue-&gt;This will get me closer]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="It&#39;s a personal matter." tags="" position="1664,1372" size="100,100">Jane::I...understand.

Jane::I&#39;ll...see if I can get you into some of the less restricted records closets.  But I can&#39;t make any promises.  And there&#39;s no chance we can visit anything above SENSITIVE classification.

She wants to help, but she also want to keep the rule bending to a minimum.  Though I&#39;m not sure who enforces the &quot;rules&quot; these days.

[[Continue-&gt;This will get me closer]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="This will get me closer" tags="" position="1506,1526" size="100,100">It&#39;s clear that you and Jane aren&#39;t quite getting through to one another.  She seems to have a very warped view of the present environment - or at the very least it&#39;s at odds with your own.  

But if you follow her to get signed in, whatever that might mean, she promises to take you to the operations ward, where you might reunite with Wigley and find the records you&#39;re after. 

Jane drops the rag she was holding and wrings the last drops of water off of her hands.  She subtly turns to face the doorframe, motioning for you to follow her.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
