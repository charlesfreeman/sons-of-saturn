Well, I wasn&#39;t expecting to hear any complaints this early.

This is one of their favorite tricks.  Splitting caravans.  Producing dramatic noises.  The works.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="(Action) Try to open the door" tags="" position="607,1197" size="100,100">Omniscient Voice:You plant your left foot with such firm force it might as well be caked in concrete.  Without thought, your left glute tightens and your core tenses up.  You&#39;ve adopted the unshakability of a tree stump.  No, you ARE a tree stump.  A stump with a mighty right leg attached.  Without words, you raise your right foot and tuck it in, like a cobra ready to strike.

The moment of action arrives.  Your right foot springs forward like a head springing from a Jack in the Box.  

*kethunk*

First Contact is made.  A ripple shoots through your leg and into your pelvis, dissipating before making it to your torso and left thigh.  The force was completely reflected by the door.  It does not possess the manners to react to your boot in any meaningful way.

Wigley:That&#39;s not going to do anything

[[Oww!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Is this door locked now?" tags="" position="421,1198" size="100,100">Wigley:&quot;Locked&quot; is an understatement.  &quot;Completely sealed&quot; is more accurate.  The will of the Cradle is that this door remains shut.

*kethunk*

Other than the shock waves though, nothing happens.  

Not even Wigley seems impressed.  He seemed at least amused the first time.

Wigley:I told you that wasn&#39;t going to do anything.

Did I even tell you how I got the name &quot;Wigley?&quot;  It was not my birth name.  I have the soul of an octopus.  

There&#39;s an elaborate network of steam tunnels that run all throughout The Cradle.  They&#39;re too narrow and contorted for most people to fit through - that&#39;s why children were typically selected to maintain and repair them.  But I&#39;m flexible, and skinny, and...Wiggle-y, enough to get through them without much issue, even as an adult.

I&#39;ll have to backtrack a bit, but I now a route through the pipes I can follow that should spit me out at the back of the maternity wards.  That&#39;s where most of the birth records are anyway, last I checked.  We can reconvene there

This is one of the safest parts of The Cradle.  Even if you do get lost you won&#39;t run into much trouble.

And you&#39;ll have to try pretty hard to get lost.  The infirmary isn&#39;t particularly labyrinth in layout.

Harmless remnants tend to lurk around the outskirts of the Cradle.  You might find they have some useful info about the documents around.

I&#39;ve got to go.  Remember, we&#39;ll meet up on the opposite edge of the infirmary.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>

Despite the frigidness, the pool before you picks up motion in a kinetic swirl.  Peering deeply into the pool, you notice an anguished texture appear on the surface of the water

Before you lies the twisted, unfulfilled forms of countless very young children.  Wigley approaches from your left and mutters a curt expression into your ear

Wigley:My god, look at them.  What has Georgia done...

Wigley:Water Lilies, why have you been locked within the pool?  Mere months ago and you still roamed this reclaimed land. 

Narrator:The swirling congealment before you begins to swell.  Their congealed mass communicates with you, not with words but with more immediate expressions of their desires.

Beautiful and Horrific Mass:The Cradle freed Georgia.  This morning, powerful phenomena were observed all over the Infirmary.  Georgia&#39;s containment buffer was flung open, as if by design.

Wigley:Only this morning?  Mere hours ago?

Narrator:Perfectly coinciding with your entry into the zone.  That&#39;s not a good look.

Wigley:So...just as soon as we entered the zone.
