In the center is a small gurney flanked by antiquated medical eqipment, all of it covered in a thick layer of grime.  The arrangement of materials is oddly artificial.

Julia::Please, mam, lie down on the table.  We just need to get a few physical readings from you.

[[This gurney?  This entire setup looks a little...insufficiently sterilized.]]

Julia::As I said, it&#39;ll only be a few quick inspections.

Julia::No, you don&#39;t.  We need to perform at least cursory inspections before we can admit you into operations. 

Julia::I&#39;m sorry, miss, but we can&#39;t accept the risk of performing operations without making sure our patients are healthy enough to go through with it.

[[p:Alright.  I have to make it to operations.  So let&#39;s get this over with.-&gt;p:Fine, let&#39;s get this over with.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="p:Will this require anything invasive?

I just need to perform a few quick inspections to ensure that you don&#39;t have any underlying health issues before we move forward.

You waded through a sewer just to get here, stop pretending to be anything other than vile.

Julia::Do not be alarmed miss.  We are a little short staffed right now, true, but all of the important equipment has been thoroughly sterilized.

[[C-&gt;Start]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="p:(Action) Lay down on the bed, relaxed." tags="" position="1207,1091" size="100,100">You lay flat on your back atop the dust covered gurney.  A pair of more modern surgical lights are wheeled in over you, though they are not yet turned on.  

You feel like a museum piece.

Julia::Let&#39;s start by taking your blood pressure.

[[p:Alright.]]
[[p:It&#39;s probably pretty high right now.-&gt;p:Alright.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="p:Three." tags="" position="1298,3650" size="100,100">Awck!  A sharp stinging pain rings throughout your left arm.  

Sharp, piercing, hot.  A needle jab.  

[[p:Hey!  Did you just jab me?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="p:Hey!  Did you just jab me?" tags="" position="1292,3802" size="100,100">Julia::Please, miss, relax.  It was just a pinprick.

[[p:You said that you wouldn&#39;t jab me with anything!  What did you just put in me?]]
[[p:Cut the shit, what was I just injected with?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="p:You said that you wouldn&#39;t jab me with anything!  What did you just put in me?" tags="" position="1433,3943" size="100,100">Julia::Please, miss, there&#39;s no need to make a scene.  I only provided a small dose of anti-anxiolytics and muscle relaxants, intramuscular, just to make the procedure a bit easier for you.

Julia::And you aren&#39;t being charged anything for it either.  Really I&#39;m doing you a pretty big favor.

She places her hands back on your collar bones.

Julia::We&#39;re finished with the inspection, miss.  We can go on to operations.

[[p:Who cares!  You said this physical would be non-invasive!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="p:Who cares!  You said this physical would be non-invasive!" tags="" position="1282,4109" size="100,100">Julia::Come on, you can hardly call that little prick &quot;invasive.&quot;  And had I warned you about it, it only would have given you anxiety.

[[p:I&#39;m done with this physical.]]
[[p:(Action) Get up from the gurney without speaking.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="p:I&#39;m done with this physical." tags="" position="1179,4269" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="p:(Action) Get up from the gurney without speaking." tags="" position="1401,4267" size="100,100">You lurch forward, off of the gurney, and dust yourself off.

[[p:Take me to operations.  Now.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="p:Alright." tags="" position="1207,1241" size="100,100">Julia slips a small band around your left bicep.  Her fingers run along your forearm and elbow as they drag the band up.

[[C-&gt;Pressure]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Pressure" tags="" position="1205,1391" size="100,100">After the band is put in place, she gently lifts her fingers and turns to one of the machines.  You hear a slight whir.  Pressure begins accumulating on your bicep.

Julia::Hmm.  How old are you, miss?

[[How old are *you*?]]
[[p:I&#39;m 27.]]
[[p:(Lie) I&#39;m 23.-&gt;p:I&#39;m 27.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="How old are *you*?" tags="" position="1096,1546" size="100,100">Julia::I&#39;m only 32 myself, miss.

She looks a bit older to you.  But not much.

[[C-&gt;Pressure]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="p:I&#39;m 27." tags="" position="1295,1547" size="100,100">Julia::Hmm.  Your blood pressure is a little bit higher than it should be at your age.  Still within tolerances though, I suppose.

You spent too much time drinking and smoking in your early twenties.  Your body is already a shambles.  This is why you have dreams about your teeth falling out.

[[p:Good to know.]]
[[p:I&#39;m sure my freakish, horse-like heart rate will make up for it.-&gt;p:Good to know.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="p:Good to know." tags="" position="1295,1697" size="100,100">Julia::Now let&#39;s take a look at your heart rate.  

[[C-&gt;Stethescope]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Stethescope" tags="" position="1295,1846" size="100,100">Julia grabs a stethoscope from underneath the adjacent table and equips the headset.  She presses the diaphragm to your left collarbone and slowly slides it down your chest.  The touch is icy but intimate.

Julia::Your heart rate is a little bit lower than average - are you an athlete?

You&#39;re no athlete.  You&#39;re just presently deprived of you beloved uppers and your heart is slacking off in their administrative absense.

[[p:I try to keep myself in shape, yes.]]
[[p:No, my heart is just lazy.  And ugly.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="p:I try to keep myself in shape, yes." tags="" position="1220,1996" size="100,100">Julia::Heh, I can tell.

[[C-&gt;Dragging]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="p:No, my heart is just lazy.  And ugly." tags="" position="1370,1996" size="100,100">Julia::I...I see.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Dragging" tags="" position="1296,2149" size="100,100">While keeping the diaphragm in place with her left hand, Julia runs her fingers along your right bicep, up to your shoulder.

[[p:Part of the inspection?]]
[[p:That...feels nice.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="p:Part of the inspection?" tags="" position="1188,2296" size="100,100">Julia::Oh, no, I apologize.  You just have an impressive physique.

[[C-&gt;Removes]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="p:That...feels nice." tags="" position="1411,2297" size="100,100">Julia::I&#39;m happy to hear that.

[[C-&gt;Removes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Removes" tags="" position="1295,2446" size="100,100">Julia pulls back both the diaphragm and her right hand.

Julia::Alright, your heart rate is healthy.  Now we just need to check that your breathing is normal.

Julia::Try to take a few deep breaths for me, ok?

Julia puts her ear down directly over your mouth.  You resist intrusive thoughts about gently nibbling it.

She&#39;s close enough that you can smell her.  She smells lightly of peppermint.

[[p:(Action) Breath Deeply.-&gt;Breath]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Breath" tags="" position="1295,2596" size="100,100">You breath deeply, slowly, in and out, for two or three cycles.

[[Continue-&gt;Rises]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Rises" tags="" position="1295,2746" size="100,100">Julia rises a bit, her eyes remaining fixed on your chest.

Slowly, she guides her hand to the top of your breasts and presses down firmly.

Julia::Keep breathing, please.

[[p:(Action) Keep it together and continue to breath.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="p:(Action) Keep it together and continue to breath." tags="" position="1297,2896" size="100,100">Easy now.  In and out.  In and out.  Focus on the breath itself.

Julia::Your breathing is normal.  Though I can feel your heart rate spiking a little.

In and out.  In and out.  In and out.

[[C-&gt;Finished]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Finished" tags="" position="1295,3046" size="100,100">Julia slowly rises back up and removes her hand from your chest.  

Julia::Very good.  Just one more check.

Julia::I need you to count to zero, starting from five, going backwards.  Can you do that for me?

[[p:Sure.]]
[[p:Yes ma&#39;am.-&gt;p:Sure.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="p:Sure." tags="" position="1295,3196" size="100,100">You hear the slightest amount of shuffling.

[[p:Five.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="p:Five." tags="" position="1295,3346" size="100,100">Julia::Yes, like that.

[[p:Four.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="p:Four." tags="" position="1295,3496" size="100,100">Julia::Keep going.

[[p:Three.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="p:Cut the shit, what was I just injected with?" tags="" position="1247,3960" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="p:Take me to operations.  Now." tags="" position="1401,4417" size="100,100">Julia finally starts to look a little cross with you.

Julia::Fine, miss.  Operations is through the door on your right.  If you&#39;re so eager, you lead the way.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
