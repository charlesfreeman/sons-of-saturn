There it is again - that chill.

Ferryman::&quot;Rosalind&quot; - there it is again, that name.  Do you think they are referring to your Mom?

You&#39;ve reached the end of the stack.

Ferryman::Interesting exchange, but it doesn&#39;t tell us much about your Mom, other than that she didn&#39;t want Vera hanging around the SATURN core.  We should probably keep looking for the rest of Vera&#39;s notes, they might prove more illuminating.

Couldn&#39;t be anything too nefarious if they were willing to just leave telegrams like this in unsecured office drawers - if it was something serious they&#39;d be more cautious.

He seems eager to move on from this train of thought.  I encourage indulging him.
