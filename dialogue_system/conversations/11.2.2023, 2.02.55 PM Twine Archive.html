Many of the bottles are adorned with Latin names: Petalostigma pubescens, Eucalyptus gamophylla, Erythrophleum chlorostachys.  You can&#39;t decipher any of them.

Wafts of chemical air emanate from the cracks and loose seals afflicting many of the medicinal bottles.  You catch wafts of alcohol, formaldehyde, and unknown organic solvents.

Wiggly, after glancing over a few of the bottles, becomes a bit apprehensive.  You sense that there is something he doesn&#39;t want share.

Wiggly::A client, most often someone with connections here, enters the city.  And then, usually somewhere near the SATURN Core, they start having delusions of a third party.

Wiggly::Their presence might be innocuous enough at first - helpful, even.  But soon the client gets sick, and has trouble walking.  Start having hallucinations.

Wiggly::No matter how many times I see it happen, it never fails to shake me to my core - seeing a client, incapacitated, writhing in terror at someone in the room I cannot even see.

Wiggly::I doubt we&#39;ll find the personal artifacts we&#39;re looking for, but we might find a few clues as to her identity and exact role.

Muscle control hasn&#39;t yet returned to most of your body, but you manage to break the crusty seal incarcerating your eyes.  The light pours into your irises as if concentrated by a funnel.

This is the first time you&#39;ve seen light in nearly six hours.  You thought the light would be soothing, freeing to soak in, but it&#39;s not.  Instead you feel like a man on a life raft dying of thirst. 

As you lay flat, drops of water occasionally mist your forehead.  It feels like water torture.

Vera::I actually found something fascinating today, the first break in the monotony since my transfer.  While looking through records pertaining to the hospital&#39;s infant mortality rate, I noticed that incidents of stillbirth in the maternity ward are almost never isolated.  

Vera::As in, there is never only one stillbirth on any given day.  Always there are two or three, sometimes more, then zero for weeks or months.  That&#39;s pretty strong evidence of malpractice by one or more employees.

Vera::I&#39;m trying to isolate any obvious common denominators between the stillbirth cases; perhaps they can be tied to someone&#39;s shifts in the maternity ward.

Vera::I noticed a pattern when looking at the nurses’ time sheets: stillbirth tends to occur only when one of four or five nurses are on shift.  Currently trying to sniff out any commonalities amongst those nurses.  

Vera::Furthermore, I&#39;ve noticed the clusters of infant stillbirths nearly always coincide with an anomalous drop in the amount of ergot and datura reported in the medicinal supply cabinet.  Medicinal stocks are only recorded weekly so the correlation is rather coarse and I cannot be sure, though it is an intriguing lead nonetheless.

Vera::I&#39;ve requested my office be moved to the maternity ward, up on the second floor.  They probably think I&#39;m nuts since the offices on that floor are so much smaller.  But I need my eyes and ears there if I&#39;m to figure this out.

Entry 3.  July 8th.

Vera::I actually found something fascinating today, the first break in the monotony since my transfer.  While looking through records pertaining to the hospital&#39;s infant mortality rate, I noticed that incidents of stillbirth in the maternity ward are almost never isolated.  

Vera::As in, there is never only one stillbirth on any given day.  Always there are two or three, sometimes more, then zero for weeks or months.  That&#39;s pretty strong evidence of malpractice by one or more employees.

Vera::I&#39;m trying to isolate any obvious common denominators between the stillbirth cases; perhaps they can be tied to someone&#39;s shifts in the Maternity Ward.

Vera::Oh yeah, mood a little better.

Vera::I noticed a pattern when looking at the nurses’ time sheets: stillbirth tends to occur only when one of four or five nurses are on shift.  Currently trying to sniff out any commonalities amongst those nurses.  Furthermore, I&#39;ve noticed the clusters of infant stillbirths nearly always coincide with an anomalous drop in the amount of ergot and datura reported in the medicinal supply cabinet.  Medicinal stocks are only recorded weekly so the correlation is rather coarse and I cannot be sure, though it is an intriguing lead nonetheless.

Vera::I&#39;ve requested my office be moved to the maternity ward, up on the second floor.  They probably think I&#39;m nuts since the offices on that floor are so much smaller.  But I need my eyes and ears there if I&#39;m to figure this out.

Vera::Missed a few days again, though this time only because I&#39;m so wrapped up in my work.

Vera::I&#39;ve discovered that instances of infant mortality and stillbirth are synchronized with the medical supply irregularities I documented.  Every cluster of stillbirths is preceded by a suspicious reduction in the quantities of ergot and datura we have on hand.  

Vera::The implications of this are...chilling.  I think someone is using the ergot to induce stillbirths.

Vera::I managed to get my hands on the employee timesheets.  The pattern: over 90% of the incidents of &quot;stillbirth&quot; occurred under the direct watch of Dr. Tann or one of his nurses.

Some of the necessary medical equipment is only accessible intermittently, thus explaining the clustering.

If they perform professionally, I&#39;ll probably just keep my mouth shut.  They&#39;re probably just a discreet team providing a necessary service.
