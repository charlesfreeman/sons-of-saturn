Before you is some sort of medical table.

Ferryman::Careful, stand clear.

Ferryman::We are in the hospital&#39;s mortuary.  If you take a peak through the doorframe to your left you&#39;ll see the morgue

[[(Action) Take a peak.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="0;:Why do they have a morgue?  I thought this was an infirmary." tags="" position="786,577" size="100,100">Ferryman::Sadly, in the era the infirmary was active, death during childbirth was depressingly common.  The medical professionals here were top of the line, certainly, but they were still constrained by the limited medical knowledge available to them.

[[I thought the Cradle project started only 50 years ago?  Death during childbirth was still that common?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="0;:Was an 18 body morgue really necessary?  That seems excessive." tags="" position="935,576" size="100,100">Ferryman::This infirmary was a large facility, so a correspondingly large morgue was needed.  We could probably find accounting records pertaining to patient population and deaths somewhere in the infirmary complex, if you are truly curious.

[[Continue-&gt;rises]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="0;p:Where do we go from here?" tags="" position="1084,576" size="100,100">Ferryman::That&#39;s for you to decide, actually.  The Cradle usually responds more mercifully when the client takes the lead.  I&#39;m honestly less of a &quot;guide&quot;, and more of a &quot;sherpa.&quot; 

Ferryman::That said...I do have a few suggestions.  You&#39;re here looking for your Mom, correct?  Well, we&#39;re right below the administrative section of the infirmary.  There&#39;s a flight of stairs right outside the door behind you - they&#39;ll take you right up.

[[Shouldn&#39;t you be the one leading the way, given that you know this place like the back of your hand?]]
[[p:You really think we&#39;ll find out what happened to Mom by searching this building?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="(Action) Take a peak." tags="morgue remove_subject" position="637,764" size="100,100">You peak around the corner and are greeted by an enormous, 18 body morgue.  The apparatus appears mostly intact, though a few of the doors have been wrestled from their hinges.  Even though this facility was shuttered years ago, you can perceive a faint whiff of Formaldehyde that continues to cling to the air.

[[Continue-&gt;rises]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="I thought the Cradle project started only 50 years ago?  Death during childbirth was still that common?" tags="" position="792,764" size="100,100">Ferryman::Well, I suppose so.  Medical science has come a long way in the last half century.

[[Continue-&gt;rises]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Appears" tags="thud kneeling" position="854,275" size="100,100">He lets down the hatch in the corner very deliberately, as though to avoid making much noise.

Things will go more smoothly that way, trust me.

Ferryman::Also...I don&#39;t actually know my way around the maternity ward all that well, at least compared to the underground networks.  I know the layout perfectly well and can guide people through, but I haven&#39;t spent that much time pouring over documents here or going through every single room, accounting for everything left behind.

Ferryman::The maternity ward is a transitional area in most excursions, just a place most clients need to pass through to reach the residential districts.  Rarely do I spend much time here.

[[Continue-&gt;0;p:Where do we go from here?]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="p:You really think we&#39;ll find out what happened to Mom by searching this building?" tags="" position="1204,726" size="100,100">Ferryman::To be honest, we aren&#39;t likely to find exactly what you are looking for here.  We&#39;re probably going to need to pay a visit to operations ward or perhaps the chronic ward to find exactly what you are looking for.  

Ferryman::But we&#39;ll probably find enough info here to better narrow down our search.  Hopefully after we&#39;re done here, we&#39;ll know which section of the Cradle to focus our efforts on reaching.  We won&#39;t be able to canvas the whole region, of course.

Ferryman::You mentioned that your Mom, Rosalind, often made professional visits to this hospital, correct?

[[p:Yes, she came here for work often.  I don&#39;t have any clue why though, she wouldn&#39;t tell me.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="p:Yes, she came here for work often.  I don&#39;t have any clue why though, she wouldn&#39;t tell me." tags="" position="1204,876" size="100,100">Ferryman::Hmm.  This might go a lot more smoothly if we had any idea where she spent most of her time, or who she interacted with, while she was here.  She really communicated nothing about her visits?

[[p:No, nothing.  We just, had that kind of relationship.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="p:No, nothing.  We just, had that kind of relationship." tags="" position="1204,1026" size="100,100">That kind of lack of relationship?

Ferryman::Alright, well, this hospital is huge and we&#39;ll never be able to canvas the entirety of it - let&#39;s focus our efforts on searching the administration building and maternity ward.

[[p:Alright, let&#39;s start looking.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="p:Alright, let&#39;s start looking." tags="" position="1204,1176" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="rises" tags="rises" position="855,429" size="100,100">TAG
