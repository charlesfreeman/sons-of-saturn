Jane::...

Jane::Hey, are you feeling alright?  You look unwell, Miss.  And some of what you said on the way here was pretty kooky.

You do not feel alright.  

[[Continue-&gt;Not Alright]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Not Alright" tags="" position="1177,763" size="100,100">Yes.  Yes.. No, you are not fine.  You are...bad-feeling.

Hildegardian distortions are afflicting your visual field, and an aching tension has colonized your jaw.  Furthermore, an unmistakably metallic taste is blistering your tongue.

What&#39;s more, standing without falling over is quickly becoming a task that requires your manual attention.  Your proprioceptive competencies have been reduced to goop - standing is now a &quot;manual mode&quot; activity.  

You are losing your balance, quickly.  

[[p:(Action) Find something to grab and regain balance.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="p:(Action) Find something to grab and regain balance." tags="" position="1177,913" size="100,100">You flail your hands wildly, hoping to find an anchor to cling to.  Your right hand lands first, finding a handle on the nearby medical cabinet.  The left hand, having failed in its exhibition, joins the right on the cabinet.

Your anchoring to the medical cabinet proves shortlived, unfortunately.  Even with your distorted senses, you can feel that the cabinet isn&#39;t as heavy as you imagined.  You can feel it tipping towards you.

[[p:(Action) Dodge out of the way.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="p:(Action) Dodge out of the way." tags="" position="1177,1063" size="100,100">You end up not so much &quot;dodging&quot; as &quot;proactively falling.&quot;  You flail forwards towards the back of the room, mostly clear of the falling cabinet, but your legs end up pinned underneath.  You see a number of bottles and a few syringes roll into your field of view.

Not a moment later, you hear clanging footsteps ambling towards you.  

[[Continue-&gt;Restraint]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Restraint" tags="" position="1177,1213" size="100,100">Jane puts one of her knees between your shoulderblades and arrests your left wrist, pulling it behind your back.  Her skin is icy.  You could sense your audio-visual distortions intensifying the moment her skin touched yours.  

She&#39;s restraining you, and she&#39;s poisoning you.

[[p:Hey!  Let me go!]]
[[p:Jane, what are you doing?!?-&gt;p:Hey!  Let me go!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="p:Hey!  Let me go!" tags="" position="1178,1364" size="100,100">Jane::The patient is behaving violently, initiating restrainment procedures.

She pretends not to hear you.  You almost believe she really doesn&#39;t hear you.

You instinctively struggle a bit, but you remain in a pretty tight squeeze.  Jane has a stranglehold on your left wrist, and has her knee on your back.  Your legs remain pinned by the medical cabinet, though you can tell it isn&#39;t too heavy.  

Only your right arm remains emancipated.  Don&#39;t delay making use of it.

[[(Action) Grab a hypodermic needle and stab Jane]]
[[(Action) Look at the needle.]]
[[0,1:I thought you weren&#39;t supposed to share needles.]]
[[1,p:(Action) Stab yourself with the hypodermic needle.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="(Action) Grab a hypodermic needle and stab Jane" tags="" position="914,1545" size="100,100">You sieze the needle and violently strike Jane&#39;s right thigh.  The tactile sensation of penetrating her envelope, breaking her epidermis, makes an electric shock shiver down your spine.  You shake off the intrusions for now.

Jane doesn&#39;t react to the invasion in any way.  She isn&#39;t even trying to prevent a second strike.  Your shoulder blades and left wrist begin to feel like ice.

[[Continue-&gt;p:Hey!  Let me go!]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="(Action) Look at the needle." tags="" position="1084,1546" size="100,100">You drag the vial into your field of view.  You can make out the label now.  The needle contains a dose of norepinephrine.

Inject it!  Straight into the mainline.  Sister Ray style.  You&#39;ll get the boost you you need to wrestle out of this trap and escape.

[[Continue-&gt;p:Hey!  Let me go!]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="1,p:(Action) Stab yourself with the hypodermic needle." tags="" position="1438,1546" size="100,100">You haphazardly plunge the needle into the outer side of your right thigh, midway between your hip and knee.  The sting of violent self-penetration reverberates through your leg.

Jane::...Aaahg!...

Jane releases her grip and throws herself back.  Predictably, you failed to navigate the norepinephrine to a viable vein, but stabbing yourself seems to have thrown Jane off balance.  

[[p:(Action) Free yourself.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="0,1:I thought you weren&#39;t supposed to share needles." tags="" position="1263,1546" size="100,100">You aren&#39;t, but you&#39;ve got more pressing concerns.  HIV takes 50 years to kill you these days.

[[Continue-&gt;p:Hey!  Let me go!]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="p:(Action) Free yourself." tags="" position="1438,1696" size="100,100">You pull your legs out from under the cabinet, and coil yourself into a pouncing position.  You need to get up and make a run for it.

You notice your left hand is covered in blood.

[[p:(Action) Turn around, stand up, and make a run for it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="p:(Action) Turn around, stand up, and make a run for it." tags="" position="1438,1846" size="100,100">You twist around and begin to rise.  This simple act of bodily coordination requires your full attention and no small amount of effort.  You begin by pressing your chest up and tucking in your knees.  You then quickly but deliberately put your weight on your right foot, careful not to tip over.  You begin to push your center of mass up.

[[Continue-&gt;Standing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Standing" tags="" position="1438,1996" size="100,100">Your balance fades slightly as your right leg nears full extension but your able to catch yourself by reflexively positioning your left leg - it seems not all of your automatic bodily functions are disabled.  Both your legs are fully extended now.  You&#39;re doing it.  You&#39;re standing.

[[p:Turn around.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="p:Turn around." tags="" position="1438,2146" size="100,100">Run.

[[p:(Action) Run out the door.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="p:(Action) Run out the door." tags="" position="1438,2296" size="100,100">You still haven&#39;t fully regained the capacity to coordinate your muscles.  You ramble through the door, clumsily but successfully.

Fuck, which way do you go?  Left or right?

[[p:Left.]]
[[p:Right.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="p:Left." tags="" position="1363,2446" size="100,100">Yeah!  Our right half is worn out.  It&#39;s had to do all the stabbing and standing and grabbing for the last few minutes.  Let&#39;s give the right side a break and dart left.

[[Continue-&gt;Ramble]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="p:Right." tags="" position="1513,2446" size="100,100">Yeah, right has been going well for us lately.  Had to use your right arm for stabbing, grabbing, and all that.  And by god it got the job done.

Now, run, no, ramble down the hallway!

[[p:(Action) Ramble down the hallway.-&gt;Ramble]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Ramble" tags="" position="1429,2602" size="100,100">Hell yeah we&#39;re moving, at a pretty solid clip too!  And you&#39;ve avoided touching the walls on the left, and the right!  We are going down the hallway!

We should avoid becoming the victims of our own success though.  The corner is fast approaching.  Someone with better judgement might suggest you slow down and take the turn slow.  But I think you can drift it, chief.

[[p:(Action) Slow down and take the turn slow.]]
[[p:(Action) Tire screeching drift maneuver.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="p:(Action) Slow down and take the turn slow." tags="" position="1354,2752" size="100,100">Yes, yes, let&#39;s slow down.  But how do we do that?  Which part of our body is supposed to slowdown first?  The wall is approaching, quick!  Turn off your legs!  

[[p:(Action) Slow down your legs.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="p:(Action) Tire screeching drift maneuver." tags="" position="1504,2752" size="100,100">Unfortunately you have badly miscalculated the speed at which an inertia-laden body and pivot directions in a graceful manner.  You twist your pelvis and torso to greet the new direction as you round the corner, but your legs fail to follow suit.  As such you slam your shoulder blade into the wall, and your temple slaps into the upper embroidery.  

[[Continue-&gt;Assess]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="p:(Action) Scream and keep moving." tags="" position="1455,3271" size="100,100">LET&#39;S FUCKING GOOO.

You&#39;re really rambling now.  Truth be told it&#39;s not as much of a team effort after your collision though.  Once again your right leg is doing most of the heavy lifting, with your left dragging behind it.  Consequently, you also keep coming dangerously close to the right wall.

You are undeniably progressing though.  By god you are nearly back to the foyer.

Oh, yeah, what are we going to do when we reach the foyer?

[[p:That&#39;s your job to figure out.]]
[[p:Find some place to hide.]]
[[p:Look for a way out of this place.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="p:(Action) Slow down your legs." tags="" position="1354,2902" size="100,100">You slowed down your legs, but forgot how to do the same with your torso.  Consquently you&#39;ve eaten shit on the ground.  

[[p:I didn&#39;t forget how to slow down my torso, you forgot to tell me.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="p:I didn&#39;t forget how to slow down my torso, you forgot to tell me." tags="" position="1354,3052" size="100,100">We&#39;ll hold everyone to account later.  Right now you need to dust off and keep moving.

[[Continue-&gt;Assess]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="Assess" tags="" position="1499,3119" size="100,100">There&#39;s no time to assess the damage.  You&#39;ve got to keep moving.  You&#39;ll have time to feel the pain of impact later, the adrenaline will do the labor of suppressing it for now.  

[[p:(Action) Scream and keep moving.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="p:That&#39;s your job to figure out." tags="" position="1305,3421" size="100,100">Yeah, I&#39;ll get right on that.  Let me know if you come up with anything in the meantime.

[[Continue-&gt;Nearly There]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="p:Find some place to hide." tags="" position="1455,3421" size="100,100">Yeah, you can hide behind one of the pillars.  Jane will just do a cursory ocular scan, then go back to tracing the same route up and down the infirmary corridors indefinitely.  You don&#39;t need to worry about her, you know, looking behind the pillar.

[[Continue-&gt;Nearly There]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="p:Look for a way out of this place." tags="" position="1605,3421" size="100,100">Don&#39;t you need Wigley to open the hatch for you?  And besides, you wouldn&#39;t want to leave him behind.

[[Continue-&gt;Nearly There]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Nearly There" tags="" position="1455,3575" size="100,100">You&#39;ve made it into the Foyer.  You hear footsteps following you.  Look for a place to hide!

[[(Action) Look Left.]]
[[(Action) Look Down.]]
[[(Action) Look Right.]]
[[2,p:(Action) Follow Wigley into the tunnels.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="(Action) Look Left." tags="" position="1305,3725" size="100,100">Populate Later</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="(Action) Look Down." tags="" position="1455,3725" size="100,100">Populate Later.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="(Action) Look Right." tags="" position="1605,3725" size="100,100">On the right, you see-

Hey, look.  That&#39;s Wigley!

Wigley::This way.

Wisely, he speaks in a subdued tone.  He must know someone is after you.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="2,p:(Action) Follow Wigley into the tunnels." tags="" position="1764,3731" size="100,100">You propel yourself to the tunnel entrance, and ungangly, yet awe inspiring and majestic sight.

[[Continue-&gt;Looking Down Hatch]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Looking Down Hatch" tags="" position="1764,3880" size="100,100">As you approach the hatch Wigley begins descending the ladder.  Follow his lead.

[[p:(Action) Descend.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="p:(Action) Descend." tags="" position="1764,4030" size="100,100">Getting your right foot onto the top rung goes smoothly enough, but getting the left on proves tricky.  You miss the next rung, and feel your foot unexpectedly hit the one beneath.  You lose grip and fall back.

[[Continue-&gt;Fall]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Fall" tags="" position="1764,4180" size="100,100">You fall about six feet, onto your back.  You bring Wigley down with you.  You lay back, staring up at the open hatch.

[[Wiggly, close the hatch.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Wiggly, close the hatch." tags="" position="1764,4330" size="100,100">Wiggly shakes himself out of his shock, then processes your command.  He seems to understand.  He collects himself and hurries to the top of the ladder.  You can sense light footsteps inducing vibrations in the dust above, causing minute amounts of insulation to fall onto your face.

Wiggly makes it to the top of the ladder and closes the latch, locking it as he does so.  </tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
