This is the repo for Sons of Saturn, the abandonment game created using the Godot game engine.

The game is free software, but this repo is not meant for (and was not designed for) home compilation in mind.  Those hoping to play the game can access it through the Steam distribution platform.

Free compiled binaries will likely be added to this repo soon, but not at this moment.
