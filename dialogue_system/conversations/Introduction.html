You thought the light would be soothing, freeing to soak in, but it&#39;s not.  

Instead you feel like a man on a life raft dying of thirst.  Water water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.  A celibate monk at the moment of greatest temptation.  Indulgence would be fatal.

And yet you cannot help but fixate on the light above.  You lie flat on your back and stare up the well, rapt and in awe.

As you lay flat, drops of water occasionally mist your forehead.  It feels like water torture.

[[We&#39;ve only been crawling through the sewer for six hours?]] 
[[p:(Progression) I want to climb out.  Feel the sun and the air.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="We&#39;ve only been crawling through the sewer for six hours?" tags="" position="827,576" size="100,100">Didn&#39;t it feel more like eight?  But yes, it&#39;s 10:00 in the morning, and you entered the tunnels outside the Cradle just after 4:00.  

If it&#39;s any consolation, that means you&#39;ve been moving at a pretty steady clip.  Fifteen miles in six hours is respectable time by sewer-speed standards.

[[Continue-&gt;Looking Up]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="p:(Progression) I want to climb out.  Feel the sun and the air." tags="" position="1054,576" size="100,100">You easily could climb this well.  Even fatigued, chimney-ing up this cylinder would require only mild sweating and grunting.

But you won&#39;t.

[[Why wouldn&#39;t I?  Why can&#39;t I just pop out the top and bask in the light?]]
[[But sunlight is the only thing I crave.  I&#39;m climbing out of this well and basking in it for a bit.]]
[[p:(Progression) It&#39;s not too late to turn back.

I&#39;m climbing out of this well and basking in it for a bit." tags="" position="1048,745" size="100,100">Alright, go for it.  No reason you can&#39;t get out of here and roll around in the fresh air for a few minutes.  You&#39;ve afforded yourself that much before.  We both know you&#39;ll climb right back down though.

Go ahead.  Don&#39;t be long now.

...

See?  You don&#39;t have the nerve.  

[[Continue-&gt;p:(Progression) I want to climb out.  Feel the sun and the air.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="p:(Progression) It&#39;s not too late to turn back.  I can just pop out of this well and run straight out of the Cradle." tags="" position="1236,750" size="100,100">Well, it actually is kind of too late for that.  In the material sense, no less.  

No, really.  You&#39;ve been tunneling for six hours.  You&#39;re well into the off-limits section of the Cradle.  You could probably get away with popping your head out for a few minutes, but trying to get out of here without your Ferryman guide would be suicide.  

Speaking of, shouldn&#39;t he be here by now?  You were only a few minutes ahead of him.

[[p:(Action) Shout for the Ferryman]]
[[p:(Action) Just wait and enjoy the view a bit longer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Why wouldn&#39;t I?  Why can&#39;t I just pop out the top and bask in the light?" tags="" position="853,745" size="100,100">Look at yourself.  You are covered in tar and stuck to the top of a terrifying but beautiful horse.  And the horse is doing its damndest to keep you down there, at the bottom of this well.  Anyone would find it difficult to climb under those circumstances.

You came here for a reason.  You might flirt with the idea of bailing, escaping your fate, but deep down we both know what track your on.

[[Why do I need to continue into the Cradle?  What&#39;s so important about that place?]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="p:(Action) Shout for the Ferryman" tags="" position="1161,900" size="100,100">The reverberations of your voice bouncing off the sewer walls sound unearthly and strained.  One could be forgiven for thinking that a screaming donkey in heat resided in this tunnel.

...

No response from the Ferryman.  I think its time to discontinue the experimental orchestra and get back to sunbathing.

[[p:How much longer do I have left?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="p:(Action) Just wait and enjoy the view a bit longer" tags="" position="1311,900" size="100,100">That&#39;s a pretty enthralling circle isn&#39;t it?  Simply sublime.

But really though, how long can you stay entertained by staring at a hole in the ceiling?

[[p:How much longer do I have left?]] 




</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="p:How much longer do I have left?" tags="" position="1237,1054" size="100,100">Until the Ferryman catches up to you?  Who knows.

Or until you reach the end of this god forsaken sewer and finally find your way into the infirmary?  I don&#39;t know that either.  But probably not too long.

[[p:I just need to get in, find out what happened to Mom, and get out.  It&#39;ll be a breeze.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="p:I just need to get in, find out what happened to Mom, and get out.  It&#39;ll be a breeze." tags="" position="1237,1204" size="100,100">Yep, pretty sure the situation won&#39;t get any more complicated than that.  These tunnels will take you straight to the infirmary, right at the edge of the Cradle.  You&#39;ll pop out of an indoor manhole cover or whatever, find a nicely formatted document explaining what happend to your Mom on a nearby desk, and then escape the same way you got in.

[[You sound facetious, internal monologue.  Or whatever you are.]]
[[What if I can&#39;t find any trace of what happened to mom?]]
[[p:This will all be worth it, right?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="You sound facetious, internal monologue.  Or whatever you are." tags="" position="1036,1357" size="100,100">So you aren&#39;t too tone-deaf, it seems.  You&#39;re right, I&#39;m being facetious.  The Cradle is never that simple.  The knotted complex of buildings inside twist and turn in every direction, full of traps and surprises.

That&#39;s why you had to hire a Ferryman as a guide.

[[Continue-&gt;p:I just need to get in, find out what happened to Mom, and get out.  It&#39;ll be a breeze.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="p:This will all be worth it, right?" tags="" position="1359,1351" size="100,100">If you find the closure your after, miraculously cure all your psychic ills in the process, use your newfound unhindered and undamaged brain to become rich, famous, and wildly successful, and then retire early, then sure, this excursion will be &quot;worth it.&quot;  

But if you die here, you probably wouldn&#39;t consider it &quot;worth it.&quot;

[[If I die I wouldn&#39;t consider it &quot;not worth it&quot; either, technically]]
[[0;:I&#39;m not a sea turtle.  I&#39;m more similar to one of those toxic octopi]]
[[1;p:Hopefully my Ferryman shows up soon, that way I can at least die closer to my goal and not in this shitty tunnel]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="If I die I wouldn&#39;t consider it &quot;not worth it&quot; either, technically" tags="" position="1052,1574" size="100,100">Vacuously, that&#39;s true.  But you&#39;d consider it a shame right now, wouldn&#39;t you?  While your still breathing?

Think about everything that would leave unresolved.  All the humiliations and all the pain that would ultimately amount to nothing if you were to die here, rendering your entire life absurd.  You don&#39;t want that do you?

You&#39;d be comparable to one of the baby sea turtles who never makes it to the ocean.  You were born, pecked at, and now you&#39;ll die.

[[No one wants that.]] 
[[Everything is relaxed when there&#39;s no anything.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="No one wants that." tags="" position="862,1670" size="100,100">But plenty of people *get* that.

You think any baby sea turtle plans on being the one to get eaten by a crab?  You think any kid in Scottish folk tales plans on being one of the children dragged down by a Kelpie?

Let&#39;s make sure you aren&#39;t one of them.  Because it&#39;s a real possibility, a real fate that could befall you.

[[Continue-&gt;p:This will all be worth it, right?]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="1;p:Hopefully my Ferryman shows up soon, that way I can at least die closer to my goal and not in this shitty tunnel" tags="" position="1542,1507" size="100,100">Yeah, dying after actually entering the Cradle proper would be a lot less humiliating at least.  You&#39;ve gotta protect your reputation among the cabal of observers you&#39;re imagining in your head right now.

Speaking of, what&#39;s that noise?

[[Continue-&gt;Ferryman]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Everything is relaxed when there&#39;s no anything." tags="" position="1137,1716" size="100,100">So you would consider the fate of 99.9% of baby sea turtles a success?  After all, there&#39;s nothing to resolve if you&#39;ve been eaten by a crab.

[[Continue-&gt;p:This will all be worth it, right?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Ferryman" tags="ferryman" position="1541,1658" size="100,100">Ferryman::...

Ferryman::Is everything alright Miss?

[[Why do you think there&#39;s something wrong with me?]]
[[p:I feel fine.  What took you so long?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Why do you think there&#39;s something wrong with me?" tags="" position="1422,1822" size="100,100">Ferryman::I apologize.  I just...got concerned when I saw you lying flat on your back.

Lying in diluted sewage, no less.

[[Continue-&gt;Ferryman]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="p:I feel fine.  What took you so long?" tags="" position="1639,1820" size="100,100">Ferryman::Apologies for falling behind, I&#39;m not as fit as I was when I first became a Ferryman.  I couldn&#39;t keep up with someone as athletic as yourself.  

Ferryman::...

Ferryman::Also, I knew it would be fine if you got a bit ahead.  The more labyrinthine portions of the sewers are behind us - its a straight shot from here to the infirmary, and only I have the key to the locked entrance ahead.

[[p:Alright, let&#39;s get going]]
[[p:Can I stay here just a bit longer?]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="p:Alright, let&#39;s get going" tags="" position="1565,1970" size="100,100">Ferryman::Yes, let&#39;s.  We want to be out of the Cradle before the sun sets.

[[Coninue-&gt;Standing Up]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="p:Can I stay here just a bit longer?" tags="" position="1705,1973" size="100,100">Ferryman::Well... I would like to accomodate this request, but I really cannot recommend staying here for any longer.  The water levels in these tunnels rise during mid-day.  And we shouldn&#39;t waste time - we don&#39;t know exactly where the documents you are after are, and we should avoid being stuck in the Cradle after sunset.

He&#39;s being polite.  Staying here any longer is an awful idea.

[[Continue-&gt;Standing Up]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Standing Up" tags="" position="1632,2132" size="100,100">Ferryman::If it&#39;s any consolation, the maternity ward ahead was designed to allow for an abundance of natural lighting.  The chief architect believed such a design might mitigate the effects of post-partum depression.  You&#39;ll see more of the sun. 

You aren&#39;t really after the sunlight though.  You take one last look up the well.  The view remains painful, as if you are offered an appetizer but denied the main course.  

You can feel increasingly insistent marionette strings pulling you further down the tunnel.  There&#39;s no hopping off the tracks now.

You rise to your feet, and beat senselessly further down the tunnel.





</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="What if I can&#39;t find any trace of what happened to mom?" tags="" position="1178,1357" size="100,100">Then you&#39;re out of luck.  Organizing this infiltration took a full year.  Scrounging up enough to pay the Ferryman&#39;s broker took several months on top of that.  And that only supplemented the very large loan you took out to pay for this clandestine excursion.  

So, you better hope you find a little emotional closure somewhere in there.  You&#39;ll suffer a very poor return on investment otherwise.

[[Continue-&gt;p:I just need to get in, find out what happened to Mom, and get out.  It&#39;ll be a breeze.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="0;:I&#39;m not a sea turtle.  I&#39;m more similar to one of those toxic octopi" tags="" position="1361,1509" size="100,100">You are full of poison.  You got that much correct.  So in a way, you are pretty similar to an aquatic blue-ringed fiend.  

But you&#39;ve also got a lot in common with an octopus&#39;s victim.  You&#39;re a tourist sap who ended up petrified on the beach, pumped full of tetrodotoxin, unable even to close their eyes, staring directly at the sun.

You are flat on your back, paralyzed.  You even lack the wit to shut your eyelids, and the foreign sun is turning your irises into swiss cheese.

[[Continue-&gt;p:This will all be worth it, right?]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Why do I need to continue into the Cradle?  What&#39;s so important about that place?" tags="" position="853,895" size="100,100">Ostensibly, you came here to find out what happened to your Mom.  Everyone who comes to the Cradle is looking for closure of some form, and you&#39;re no different.  

[[Why should I care about finding my mom?  I want to run around in a grassy field and get dehydrated and then get stung by a bunch of bees, or maybe a bullet ant.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Why should I care about finding my mom?  I want to run around in a grassy field and get dehydrated and then get stung by a bunch of bees, or maybe a bullet ant." tags="" position="851,1044" size="100,100">She disappeared nine years ago, when you were 13 years old.  The void she left scabbed over, got filled with scar tissue - but never really healed.  No hair follicules grow in that part of your psyche.

Your mom was research faculty at the HART generating facility in the Cradle.  She, like many others, had to drop everything and escape during the collapse.  She escaped carrying a smaller, four year old version of yourself.  

Nine years ago, she hired a Ferryman and ventured back into the Cradle, trying to salvage what she could of her research.  She didn&#39;t come back.  So you came here to retrace her steps and find out what happened.  That&#39;s why you are in a sewer and not running through a field of bullet ant infested sunflowers.
