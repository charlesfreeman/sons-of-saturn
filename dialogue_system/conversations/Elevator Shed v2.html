Wiggly::Alright, I just need to swap out a few of these wires, and...

Wiggly::Oh.  That&#39;s...That&#39;s not good.  That&#39;s very not good.

Wiggly::Miss, I have some bad news.  One of the fuses on the elevator control panel has disappeared.  See?

[[C-&gt;Fuse Missing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Fuse Missing" tags="points" position="1179,756" size="100,100">He points to a vacant piece of real estate on the panel.

Wiggly::I&#39;m sorry miss, but there&#39;s no way to get the elevator to the bottom floor.

[[What good is a fuse anyway?  I didn&#39;t think this complex had power.]]
[[p:The fuse is gone?  Why would anyone have taken it?  What good is it to anybody?]]


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="p:The fuse is gone?  Why would anyone have taken it?  What good is it to anybody?" tags="pockets" position="1179,906" size="100,100">Wiggly::I...have no clue, on either count.

Wiggly::But somehow I am not shocked that the elevator has been disabled.  The Cradle has been reacting...antagonistically towards you.  More so than any other client I&#39;ve ever guided through.  

[[p:What are you suggesting?  Are you saying the Cradle itself stole the fuse?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="p:What are you suggesting?  Are you saying the Cradle itself stole the fuse?" tags="" position="1179,1056" size="100,100">Wiggly::Not necessarily.  One of the other Ferryman might have decided to block access to the Children&#39;s Ward - at least one Ferryman has disappeared there.  

Wiggly::It&#39;s also possible some scrapper stole it for himself.  That ward is known to have a decent amount of valuable material left behind, so it&#39;s a common for looters to pay a visit.  Maybe one of them decided they didn&#39;t want any competition.

Wiggly::Somehow, though, I feel like the Cradle is giving you another sign.

[[What happened to the Ferryman who disappeared there?]]
[[Scrappers steal stuff from the Children&#39;s Ward?  I thought it was extremely dangerous.]]
[[p:We need to find another route to the basement.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="What happened to the Ferryman who disappeared there?" tags="" position="1013,1216" size="100,100">Wiggly::Oh, yes.  That incident was quite a while ago, actually.  The Ferryman&#39;s name was Thompson, or something similar, I think.  He was an adoptee turned Ferryman, like me, though we didn&#39;t know each other very well.

Wiggly::The story I heard is that he had some sort of breakdown, and abandoned a client somewhere in the Maternity Ward.  Just told his client that he had business to attend to in the Children&#39;s Ward, and that he should try to get out the way they came.  Maybe they came across something that set him off?

Wiggly::The Ferryman wasn&#39;t heard from after that.  We can&#39;t even be sure he made it to the Children&#39;s Ward, though I&#39;d say it was pretty likely.  He was reasonably experienced, like myself, and that&#39;s the only place in this part of the Cradle where he wouldn&#39;t be found.

Wiggly::The client, fortunately, did make it out.  Poor guy had to navigate the drains and sewers by himself, and apparently his lamp ran out of juice towards the end.  But ultimately he made it, and told the broker what I just told you.

[[C-&gt;p:What are you suggesting?  Are you saying the Cradle itself stole the fuse?]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Scrappers steal stuff from the Children&#39;s Ward?  I thought it was extremely dangerous." tags="" position="1176,1219" size="100,100">Wiggly::It is extremely dangerous.  Scrappers generally just don&#39;t care, or, cannot afford to care.  

Wiggly::Most of them are in pretty desperate positions, and because the Children&#39;s Ward is dangerous and difficult to access, lots of valuable stuff is still left behind.  Jewelry, antiques, electronics, medicine, drugs, collectable toys.  You name it.

[[C-&gt;p:What are you suggesting?  Are you saying the Cradle itself stole the fuse?]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="p:We need to find another route to the basement." tags="" position="1337,1220" size="100,100">Wiggly::There are no other routes.  Every basement level door was welded shut before the Cradle was even abandoned.  Even the utility tunnel connections were blocked off.  

Wiggly::They only neglected to seal the basement elevator entrance because they had reprogrammed the elevator to never go there.  But, you can bypass those locks by swapping a few of these wires around.

Wiggly::Or rather, you could, before the fuse disappeared.

[[They really wanted to keep people out, huh?]]
[[(Action) Inspect the elevator equipment shed.]]
[[1,:So if we remove the bolts attaching the cable to the elevator, and then pull this lever, the elevator will plummet to the bottom floor?]]
[[2,p:I know what to do.  We&#39;ll detach the cables, then I&#39;ll go wait in the elevator.  Then, you&#39;ll pull the lever, and I&#39;ll drop down to the Children&#39;s Ward.]])</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="They really wanted to keep people out, huh?" tags="" position="1187,1370" size="100,100">Wiggly::Yeah, they did.  Unusual phenomena started plaguing the Children&#39;s Ward before the rest of the Cradle even closed.

Wiggly::I don&#39;t like going there.  I almost never do.  I only suggested we investigate that ward out of desperation.

[[C-&gt;p:We need to find another route to the basement.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="(Action) Inspect the elevator equipment shed." tags="" position="1337,1370" size="100,100">On the left side of the room, you see a large, metallic lever.  It looks like an antique prop from some old horror film.  The lever appears to be a circuit breaker switch for the elevator machinery.

[[C-&gt;Don&#39;t touch that!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="What good is a fuse anyway?  I didn&#39;t think this complex had power." tags="" position="941,903" size="100,100">Wiggly::The hospital complex doesn&#39;t have power, but this elevator equipment does.  So do a few of the surgical rooms, and I think one or two of the emergency exit stairwells.

Wiggly::The main power distribution grid hasn&#39;t been functional since the Cradle closed, but most infrastructure that was deemed critical were also supplied with their own high density fuel sources as a backup.  So stuff like surgical suites, hospital stairwells and elevators, ventilators, and the like could still run during power outages.

[[That room Julia took me to had working surgical lights.  I guess that&#39;s how.]]
[[&quot;High density fuel sources?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="That room Julia took me to had working surgical lights.  I guess that&#39;s how." tags="" position="829,1060" size="100,100">Wiggly::If the room she brought you to had working lights and equipment, then yes, I imagine so.

[[C-&gt;Fuse Missing]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="&quot;High density fuel sources?&quot;" tags="" position="997,1061" size="100,100">Wiggly::SATURN Core inventions - little cylinders you can plug into compatible circuits.  They make a weird screaming noise when you put your ear against them.  They last for decades but sometimes aren&#39;t particularly stable.

Wiggly::They&#39;re powering this elevator machinery just fine, though.  Hear that hum?

Wiggly::The lights in this room are also powered - the skylights are artificial.

[[C-&gt;Fuse Missing]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Don&#39;t touch that!" tags="" position="1339,1520" size="100,100">Wiggly::Don&#39;t touch that!  That will cut the circuit for the elevator equipment, including the backup magnetic locks keeping the elevator from falling. 

Wiggly::In principle, the cables should be strong enough to keep it in place, but I&#39;d rather not test them.  You never trust rusty cables like these after you&#39;ve seen them snap like twine.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="1,:So if we remove the bolts attaching the cable to the elevator, and then pull this lever, the elevator will plummet to the bottom floor?" tags="" position="1503,1373" size="100,100">Wiggly::Yes.  But why would you want to do that?  All that would accomplish is permanently disabling the elevator.

[[Is finding the missing fuse an option?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="2,p:I know what to do.  We&#39;ll detach the cables, then I&#39;ll go wait in the elevator.  Then, you&#39;ll pull the lever, and I&#39;ll drop down to the Children&#39;s Ward." tags="concerned" position="1857,1324" size="100,100">Wiggly looks almost a little flushed.

Wiggly::Miss.  Please.  That&#39;s ridiculous - bordering on suicidal, even.  Once this line is cut, and the break is released, nothing will serve to retard the elevator&#39;s free-fall.

Wiggly::The elevator is idling on the roof and would drop all the way down to the first floor.  That&#39;s nearly a ten meter drop.

Don&#39;t let him talk you out of it, you know what you came here for.

[[Do I?]]
[[If I jump right before the elevator hits the ground, I&#39;ll float to the ground and be uninjured.]]
[[I don&#39;t have any other choice.]]
[[1,2;p:If you don&#39;t go along with it I&#39;ll pull the lever and just jump down the elevator shaft.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Is finding the missing fuse an option?" tags="" position="1503,1523" size="100,100">Wiggly::We have absolutely no lead on what happened to the first one, and the ones employed here are of a very unique, specialized type, so we won&#39;t be able to find a replacement fuse either.

[[C-&gt;p:We need to find another route to the basement.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Do I?" tags="" position="1663,1517" size="100,100">Yeah.  You do.

Wiggly::What&#39;s that, miss?

This woman, Julia, that&#39;s stuck to you - she has power, but she can&#39;t follow you out of the Cradle.  

Wiggly::I know how important this expedition is to you, and how much you sacrificed to come here, but please do not feel as though you don&#39;t have the option to turn back.

Dismissed.  Moving on.

[[C-&gt;2,p:I know what to do.  We&#39;ll detach the cables, then I&#39;ll go wait in the elevator.  Then, you&#39;ll pull the lever, and I&#39;ll drop down to the Children&#39;s Ward.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="If I jump right before the elevator hits the ground, I&#39;ll float to the ground and be uninjured." tags="" position="1822,1510" size="100,100">Wiggly::Miss, that is a common misconception.  If you are hurdling towards the ground at 20 meters per second, and jump up at a speed of 1 meter per second, well...

Wiggly::You&#39;ll hit the ground at 19 meters per second.

You knew all of that, but were hoping it might convince him to go along with this plan.  Smart move, but unfortunately he knew better.  You&#39;ll have to secure his compliance some other way.

[[C-&gt;2,p:I know what to do.  We&#39;ll detach the cables, then I&#39;ll go wait in the elevator.

Good idea.  Now collaborating with the plan is the &quot;safe&quot; option for him.

Still, he looks a bit taken aback.

Wiggly::Miss, I can&#39;t stop you from doing this.  But please, think hard about whether or not this is worth it.  

He&#39;s coming around to the plan.

Wiggly::You might break your legs in the fall, or your spine.  There would be nothing at all I could do to help you.  

Wiggly::Is that how you want this to end?  Starving to death at the bottom of an elevator shaft with two broken legs and no painkillers?

[[Yes that&#39;s how I want to go out.]]
[[That&#39;s not going to happen.  The elevator isn&#39;t likely to fall at free-fall speed, and it&#39;s not that far of a drop anyway.-&gt;Yes that&#39;s how I want to go out.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Yes that&#39;s how I want to go out." tags="resigned" position="2151,1633" size="100,100">Suddenly the ferryman adopts a rather resigned, acquiescent look.  He&#39;s beginning to accept that there is no talking you out of this.

Wiggly::You really are gonna go through with this, aren&#39;t you?  There&#39;s no talking you out of it.

He sounds almost disappointed in himself.  A better ferryman might have convinced you to drop this, he&#39;s thinking.

[[C-&gt;Let&#39;s do this]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="p:Alright.  Thanks for helping with this." tags="" position="2150,1877" size="100,100">He does not return your thanks.  He looks sullen, hollow, even a little guilty.  He reaches into his pocket.  

[[C-&gt;Cyanide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Cyanide" tags="" position="2151,1997" size="100,100">Wiggly::Miss, you might want this.  Just in case the descent goes poorly.

All ferrymen keep some on their person, in case of emergencies.  If you end up immobilized at the bottom of the shaft, well, this might be an appealing option.

[[p:(Accept the cyanide) I hope I won&#39;t need it.  But, thanks.]]
[[p:(Decline the cyanide) Thanks, but it won&#39;t come to that.  I&#39;m certain.]]

He returns the pill to his pocket.
