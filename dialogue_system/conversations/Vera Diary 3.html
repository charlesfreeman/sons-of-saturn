Entry 5.  July 14th

Vera::Missed a few days again, though this time only because I&#39;m so wrapped up in my work.

Vera::I&#39;ve discovered that instances of infant mortality and stillbirth are synchronized with the medical supply irregularities I documented.  Every cluster of stillbirths is preceeded by a suspicious reduction in the quantities of ergot and datura we have on hand.  

Vera::The implications of this are...chilling.  I think someone is using the ergot to induce stillbirths.  That would explain why the stillbirths tend to occur in clusters, and why the medical supplies always go missing at the same time.  I&#39;m going to try and get my hands on more precise staff time sheets, ideally with hourly precision.  Maybe there&#39;s a pattern I didn&#39;t see before.

Vera::Oh, yeah, mood positive.  Driven.

[[p:She thinks someone is swiping the ergot and using it to induce abortions?]]
[[p:This lady is obsessive.  No wonder that administrator didn&#39;t want her around.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Page 2" tags="page2" position="792,830" size="100,100">Vera::Mood diary.  Entry 6.  July 16th

Vera::I managed to get my hands on the employee timesheets today.  It didn&#39;t take long for a pattern to emerge: Over 90% of the incidents of &quot;stillbirth&quot; occured either under the direct watch of Dr. Anthony Tann, or under the supervision of one of his nurses.  I suspect they are using ergot from the medical supply closet to induce miscarriage (though I&#39;m uncertain of datura&#39;s utility).  Some of the medical equipment they need is only accessible intermittently, thus explaining the clustering.  

Vera::Dr. Tann&#39;s team has two women booked for visitation in series tomorrow morning, both for obviously frivolous afflictions.  I&#39;m going to surveil one of their operations.  If they perform professionally, I&#39;ll probably just keep my mouth shut.  They&#39;re probably just a discretious team trying to provide a necessary service.  But I&#39;ve got to see it with my own eyes - I want proof this isn&#39;t some shady mob-run outfit.

Vera::There&#39;s a ventillation grate in the room they are slated to use.  I can camp in the ducts and judge how they perform.

[[p:So, Dr. Tann was running an underground abortion ring?]]
[[p:No wonder Tann didn&#39;t want Vera here...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="start" tags="" position="784,223" size="100,100">Wiggly::We&#39;re here - this is Vera&#39;s office.  Presumably the one she got after requesting a transfer.

Wiggly::I found some of her diary pages in that cabinet drawer, while I was working my way towards you. I hope you find them helpful, miss.

[[Why bother stopping here?  We agreed to meet at the end of the hall.]]
[[This office looks kind of dingy compared to her old one.]]
[[p:(Action) Search the cabinet.]]

Wiggly::We could have linked up here instead, but I thought the room at the end of the corridors would be easier for you to find.

Wiggly::She might have been correct.  Under the table abortion rings were pretty common in the Cradle.  And the medical supply irregularities are...suggestive.

Wiggly::That room at the end of the corridor is where they would have operated.

[[She must have been really dedicated to finding out the truth if she was willing to go through those disgusting tunnels.]]
[[p:I wonder if this has anything to do with Julia.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="She must have been really dedicated to finding out the truth if she was willing to go through those disgusting tunnels." tags="" position="724,1282" size="100,100">Wiggly::What do you mean?  Those are some of the nicest tunnels in the Cradle.  So spacious, you barely have to duck, and the water is less than knee deep the entire way.

There isn&#39;t even a hint of facetiousness in his voice.  He loves those tunnels.

[[C-&gt;p:Vera was planning to spy on them during one of their operations.  I wonder how that played out.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="p:I wonder if this has anything to do with Julia." tags="" position="912,1282" size="100,100">Wiggly::Something tells me it might.

Wiggly::Let&#39;s go search the top floor.  There are a few nurses quarters up there, maybe one of them belonged to Julia

Wiggly::There are also a few neonatal units up there, worth taking a look around.

Wiggly::The stairs up are just out the door, across the hall.

[[p:Alright, let&#39;s go.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="p:Alright, let&#39;s go." tags="" position="912,1432" size="100,100"></tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="This office looks kind of dingy compared to her old one." tags="" position="645,386" size="100,100">Wiggly::Really, you think so?  I think it feels cozy.

He seems to find the cramped quarters and thick layer of dust comforting, soothing.
