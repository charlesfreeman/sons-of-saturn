You find yourself flat on your back, staring up an access tube that leads to the ground above.  Muscle control hasn&#39;t yet returned to most of your body, but you manage to break the crusty seal incarcerating your eyes.  The light pours into your irises as if concentrated by a funnel.

This is the first time you&#39;ve seen sunlight in nearly six hours.  You thought the light would be soothing, freeing to soak in, but it&#39;s not.  

Instead you feel like a man on a life raft dying of thirst.  Water water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.  A celibate monk at the moment of greatest temptation.  Indulgence would be fatal.

And yet you cannot help but fixate on the light above.  You lie flat on your back and stare up the well, rapt and in awe.

As you lay flat, drops of water occasionally mist your forehead.  It feels like water torture.

[[We&#39;ve only been crawling through the sewer for six hours?]] 
[[p:I want to climb out.  Feel the sun and the air.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="We&#39;ve only been crawling through the sewer for six hours?" tags="" position="827,576" size="100,100">Didn&#39;t it feel more like eight?  But yes, it&#39;s 10:00 in the morning, and you entered the tunnels outside the Cradle just after 4:00.  

If it&#39;s any consolation, that means you&#39;ve been moving at a pretty steady clip.  Fifteen miles in six hours is respectable time by sewer-speed standards.

[[Continue-&gt;Looking Up]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="p:I want to climb out.  Feel the sun and the air." tags="" position="1054,576" size="100,100">You easily could climb this well.  Even fatigued, chimney-ing up this cylinder would require only mild sweating and grunting.

But you won&#39;t.

[[Why wouldn&#39;t I?  Why can&#39;t I just pop out the top and bask in the light?]]
[[But sunlight is the only thing I crave.  I&#39;m climbing out of this well and basking in it for a bit.]]
[[p:It&#39;s not too late to turn back.  I can just pop out of this well and run straight out of the Cradle.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="But sunlight is the only thing I crave.

No reason you can&#39;t get out of here and roll around in the fresh air for a few minutes.  You&#39;ve afforded yourself that much before.  We both know you&#39;ll climb right back down though.

Go ahead.  Don&#39;t be long now.

...

See?  You don&#39;t have the nerve.  

[[Continue-&gt;p:I want to climb out.  Feel the sun and the air.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="p:It&#39;s not too late to turn back.  I can just pop out of this well and run straight out of the Cradle." tags="" position="1236,750" size="100,100">Well, it actually is kind of too late for that.  In the material sense, no less.  

No, really.  You&#39;ve been tunneling for six hours.  You&#39;re well into the off-limits section of the Cradle.  You could probably get away with popping your head out for a few minutes, but trying to get out of here without your Ferryman guide would be suicide.  

Speaking of, shouldn&#39;t he be here by now?  You were only a few minutes ahead of him.

[[p:(Action) Shout for the Ferryman]]
[[p:(Action) Just wait and enjoy the view a bit longer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Why wouldn&#39;t I?  Why can&#39;t I just pop out the top and bask in the light?" tags="" position="853,745" size="100,100">Look at yourself.  You are covered in tar and stuck to the top of a terrifying but beautiful horse.  And the horse is doing its damndest to keep you down there, at the bottom of this well.  Anyone would find it difficult to climb under those circumstances.

You came here for a reason.  You might flirt with the idea of bailing, escaping your fate, but deep down we both know what track your on.

No one can help a puddle up the wall.

[[Why do I need to continue into the Cradle?  What&#39;s so important about that place?]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="p:(Action) Shout for the Ferryman" tags="" position="1161,900" size="100,100">The reverberations of your voice bouncing off the sewer walls sound unearthly and strained.  One could be forgiven for thinking that a screaming donkey in heat resided in this tunnel.

...

No response from the Ferryman.  I think its time to discontinue the experimental orchestra and get back to sunbathing.

[[p:How much longer do I have left?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="p:(Action) Just wait and enjoy the view a bit longer" tags="" position="1311,900" size="100,100">That&#39;s a pretty enthralling circle isn&#39;t it?  Simply sublime.

But really though, how long can you stay entertained by staring at a hole in the ceiling?

[[p:How much longer do I have left?]] 




</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="p:How much longer do I have left?" tags="" position="1237,1054" size="100,100">Until the Ferryman catches up to you?  Who knows.

Or until you reach the end of this god forsaken sewer and finally find your way into the infirmary?  I don&#39;t know that either.  But probably not too long.

[[p:I just need to get in, find out what happened to Mom, and get out.  It&#39;ll be a breeze.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="p:I just need to get in, find out what happened to Mom, and get out.  It&#39;ll be a breeze." tags="" position="1237,1204" size="100,100">Yep, pretty sure the situation won&#39;t get any more complicated than that.  These tunnels will take you straight to the infirmary, right at the edge of the Cradle.  You&#39;ll pop out of an indoor manhole cover or whatever, find a nicely formatted document explaining what happend to your Mom on a nearby desk, and then escape the same way you got in.

[[You sound facetious, internal monologue.  Or whatever you are.]]
[[What if I can&#39;t find any trace of what happened to mom?]]
[[p:This will all be worth it, right?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="You sound facetious, internal monologue.  Or whatever you are." tags="" position="1036,1357" size="100,100">So you aren&#39;t too tone-deaf, it seems.  You&#39;re right, I&#39;m being facetious.  The Cradle is never that simple.  The knotted complex of buildings inside twist and turn in every direction, full of traps and surprises.

That&#39;s why you had to hire a Ferryman as a guide.

[[Continue-&gt;p:I just need to get in, find out what happened to Mom, and get out.  It&#39;ll be a breeze.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="p:This will all be worth it, right?" tags="" position="1359,1351" size="100,100">If you find the closure your after, miraculously cure all your psychic ills in the process, use your newfound unhindered and undamaged brain to become rich, famous, and wildly successful, and then retire early, then sure, this excursion will be &quot;worth it.&quot;  

But if you die here, you probably wouldn&#39;t consider it &quot;worth it.&quot;

[[If I die I wouldn&#39;t consider it &quot;not worth it&quot; either, technically]]
[[0;:I&#39;m not a sea turtle.  I&#39;m more similar to one of those toxic octopi]]
[[1;p:Hopefully my Ferryman shows up soon, that way I can at least die closer to my goal and not in this shitty tunnel]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="If I die I wouldn&#39;t consider it &quot;not worth it&quot; either, technically" tags="" position="1052,1574" size="100,100">Vacuously, that&#39;s true.  But you&#39;d consider it a shame right now, wouldn&#39;t you?  While your still breathing?

Think about everything that would leave unresolved.  All the humiliations and all the pain that would ultimately amount to nothing if you were to die here, rendering your entire life absurd.  You don&#39;t want that do you?

You&#39;d be comparable to one of the baby sea turtles who never makes it to the ocean.  You were born, pecked at, and now you&#39;ll die.

[[No one wants that.]] 
[[Everything is relaxed when there&#39;s no anything.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="No one wants that." tags="" position="862,1670" size="100,100">But plenty of people *get* that.

You think any baby sea turtle plans on being the one to get eaten by a crab?  You think any kid in Scottish folk tales plans on being one of the children dragged down by a Kelpie?

Let&#39;s make sure you aren&#39;t one of them.  Because it&#39;s a real possibility, a real fate that could befall you.

[[Continue-&gt;p:This will all be worth it, right?]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="1;p:Hopefully my Ferryman shows up soon, that way I can at least die closer to my goal and not in this shitty tunnel" tags="" position="1542,1507" size="100,100">Yeah, dying after actually entering the Cradle proper would be a lot less humiliating at least.  You&#39;ve gotta protect your reputation among the cabal of observers you&#39;re imagining in your head right now.

Speaking of, what&#39;s that noise?

[[Continue-&gt;Ferryman]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Everything is relaxed when there&#39;s no anything." tags="" position="1137,1716" size="100,100">So you would consider the fate of 99.9% of baby sea turtles a success?  After all, there&#39;s nothing to resolve if you&#39;ve been eaten by a crab.

[[Continue-&gt;p:This will all be worth it, right?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Ferryman" tags="ferryman" position="1541,1658" size="100,100">Ferryman::...

Ferryman::Is everything alright Miss?

[[Why do you think there&#39;s something wrong with me?]]
[[p:I feel fine.  What took you so long?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Why do you think there&#39;s something wrong with me?" tags="" position="1422,1822" size="100,100">Ferryman::I apologize.  I just...got concerned when I saw you lying flat on your back.

Lying in diluted sewage, no less.

[[Continue-&gt;Ferryman]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="p:I feel fine.  What took you so long?" tags="" position="1639,1820" size="100,100">Ferryman::Apologies for falling behind, I&#39;m not as fit as I was when I first became a Ferryman.  I couldn&#39;t keep up with someone as athletic as yourself.  

Ferryman::...

Ferryman::Also, I knew it would be fine if you got a bit ahead.  The more labyrinthine portions of the sewers are behind us - its a straight shot from here to the infirmary, and only I have the key to the locked entrance ahead.

[[p:Alright, let&#39;s get going]]
[[p:Can I stay here just a bit longer?]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="p:Alright, let&#39;s get going" tags="" position="1565,1970" size="100,100">Ferryman::Yes, let&#39;s.  We want to be out of the Cradle before the sun sets.

[[p:(Action) Stand up.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="p:Can I stay here just a bit longer?" tags="" position="1711,1975" size="100,100">Ferryman::Well... I would like to accomodate this request, but I really cannot recommend staying here any longer.  The water levels in these tunnels rise during mid-day.  And we shouldn&#39;t waste time - we don&#39;t know exactly where the documents you are after are, and we should avoid being stuck in the Cradle after sunset.

He&#39;s being polite.  Staying here any longer is an awful idea.

[[p:(Action) Stand up.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="p:(Action) Stand up." tags="rise" position="1646,2133" size="100,100">You rise to your feet a little too quickly, leaving you slightly disoriented.  You can still make out the words of your Ferryman guide echoing down the drain.

Ferryman::The entrance to the Maternity Ward is just a bit further ahead.

[[How much further?]]
[[Will there be more sunlight up ahead?]]
[[p:Let&#39;s get going then.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="What if I can&#39;t find any trace of what happened to mom?" tags="" position="1178,1357" size="100,100">Then you&#39;re out of luck.  Organizing this infiltration took a full year.  Scrounging up enough to pay the Ferryman&#39;s broker took several months on top of that.  And that only supplemented the very large loan you took out to pay for this clandestine excursion.  

So, you better hope you find a little emotional closure somewhere in there.  You&#39;ll suffer a very poor return on investment otherwise.

[[Continue-&gt;p:I just need to get in, find out what happened to Mom, and get out.  It&#39;ll be a breeze.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="0;:I&#39;m not a sea turtle.  I&#39;m more similar to one of those toxic octopi" tags="" position="1361,1509" size="100,100">You are full of poison.  You got that much correct.  So in a way, you are pretty similar to an aquatic blue-ringed fiend.  

But you&#39;ve also got a lot in common with an octopus&#39;s victim.  You&#39;re a tourist sap who ended up petrified on the beach, pumped full of tetrodotoxin, unable even to close their eyes, staring directly at the sun.

You are flat on your back, paralyzed.  You even lack the wit to shut your eyelids, and the foreign sun is turning your irises into swiss cheese.

[[Continue-&gt;p:This will all be worth it, right?]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Why do I need to continue into the Cradle?  What&#39;s so important about that place?" tags="" position="853,895" size="100,100">Ostensibly, you came here to find out what happened to your Mom.  Everyone who comes to the Cradle is looking for closure of some form, and you&#39;re no different.  

[[Why should I care about finding my mom?  I want to run around in a grassy field and get dehydrated and then get stung by a bunch of bees, or maybe a bullet ant.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Why should I care about finding my mom?  I want to run around in a grassy field and get dehydrated and then get stung by a bunch of bees, or maybe a bullet ant." tags="" position="851,1044" size="100,100">She disappeared nine years ago, when you were 13 years old.  The void she left scabbed over, got filled with scar tissue - but never really healed.  No hair follicules grow in that part of your psyche.

Your mom was research faculty at the HART generating facility in the Cradle.  She, like many others, had to drop everything and escape during the collapse.  She escaped carrying a smaller, four year old version of yourself.  

Nine years ago, she hired a Ferryman and ventured back into the Cradle, trying to salvage what she could of her research.  She didn&#39;t come back.  So you came here to retrace her steps and find out what happened.  That&#39;s why you are in a sewer and not running through a field of bullet ant infested sunflowers.

[[Continue-&gt;p:I want to climb out.  Feel the sun and the air.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="How much further?" tags="" position="1484,2289" size="100,100">Ferryman::Perhaps a hundred meters, at most.  We are very close Miss.

Ferryman::In fact, that well emerges into one of the General Hospital&#39;s interior courtyards.  That&#39;s how close we are.

See?  That well was a false hope.  You made the right call.

[[C-&gt;p:(Action) Stand up.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Will there be more sunlight up ahead?" tags="" position="1649,2287" size="100,100">Ferryman::Yes, actually.  The Hospital&#39;s chief architect designed the Maternity Ward to admit an abundance of natural lighting.  He believed such a design would mitigate the effects of postpartum depression.  

See?  You never needed this well.

[[C-&gt;p:(Action) Stand up.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="p:Let&#39;s get going then." tags="" position="1801,2286" size="100,100">The Ferryman nods his head sharply in agreement.  It&#39;s time to get a move on.

The marionette strings tugging you along grow more and more insistent.  You&#39;ve been hung and drawn - now it&#39;s time to get quarted.

With my face, even." tags="" position="2392,840" size="100,100">You barely remember, but your ex once punched you directly in the jaw.  Her knuckles caught on your canines, leaving an enormous gash across the span of her index.  She was too embarrassed to seek treatment, and the finger grew deeply infected.  

She was spared amputation, but the infection left her with considerable nerve damage.  She will never use the outermost two-thirds of that finger again.  You, on the other hand, were so drunk that the blow bounced right off.

So, yeah, your face has a pretty good resume for fucking stuff up.

You are a miserable little pile of hangups and hubris and petty resentment.

[[Okay, but like, what do I do for work?]]
[[Am I suffering from any exotic medical conditions I should know about?  Do I have scurvy?]]

If anyone has an antique clock in need of repair, odds are you were the only one who could be trusted to fix it without destroying the innards.  This dynamic allowed you to price gouge with confidence.

You made a lot of money, and the nature of the work meant your social failings weren&#39;t too much of a burden.  It was a good gig.  So, you threw it all away to come here.

[[C-&gt;p:Someone I dated nearly lost her finger after punching me?

Do I have scurvy?" tags="" position="2297,1152" size="100,100">None.  Your ills are all psychic in nature.  Your brain has a few splinters embedded in it, you see.  Other than that, you are perfectly healthy.

And no, you don&#39;t have scurvy.  It is very difficult to contract scurvy.

[[C-&gt;p:Someone I dated nearly lost her finger after punching me?

Just kidding.  You&#39;re not really in Hell.  You&#39;re not really in a theater, either.  You&#39;re actually taking a nap in a wastewater tunnel.

[[p:Why the hell am I in a sewer?  Moreover, why am I taking a nap there?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="p:Why the hell am I in a sewer?  Moreover, why am I taking a nap there?" tags="" position="2418,1301" size="100,100">You&#39;re in a sewer because it&#39;s the only way to reach your goal:  The Cradle.  

You&#39;re taking a nap in the sewer because you&#39;re exhausted, and you&#39;ve gotten a bit ahead of your guide, the Ferryman.  He was really dragging his feet.  Might as well capitalize on the privacy.

[[C-&gt;Cradle]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="p:The Cradle?  The underground city I grew up in?" tags="" position="2401,1626" size="100,100">Yes.  You lived here right up until the collapse.  You weren&#39;t very happy here.

[[Why can&#39;t we take the train in from the surface?  That&#39;s how we got out during the mass evacuation.]]
[[p:I don&#39;t want to go back!]]
[[p:Alright.  I knew I&#39;d have to come back here, sooner or later.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="Why can&#39;t we take the train in from the surface?  That&#39;s how we got out during the mass evacuation." tags="" position="2315,1770" size="100,100">The trestles for every inbound train line were imploded before the evacuation was even complete.  

None of those lines will take you to the Cradle anymore.

[[C-&gt;Evacuation lines]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="p:I don&#39;t want to go back!" tags="" position="2434,1773" size="100,100">Then why did you come back?  Why leave your cushy job, just to revisit this bloated corpse of a city?

[[p:Because I have to come back.  I have to find out what happened to my Mom.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="Cradle" tags="cradle" position="2407,1457" size="100,100">That vast, beautiful utopia that managed to flame out so dramatically within a century of its inception.  Impressive in a sense, really.

Every other surface entrance was sealed decades ago.

[[p:The Cradle?  The underground city I grew up in?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="Evacuation lines" tags="" position="2315,1920" size="100,100">A few of the unidirectional outbound evacuation lines might be mostly intact.  You can&#39;t run trains inbound on those tracks, so they never bothered to collapse the trestles.

But you&#39;d have to walk the tracks, on foot, and they are hundreds of kilometers long.

So, sewer it is then.

[[What about the routes the underground pioneers took?  Aren&#39;t those still viable?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="What about the routes the underground pioneers took?  Aren&#39;t those still viable?" tags="" position="2315,2070" size="100,100">No.  Most of the underground entrances have been heavily secured.

And besides, those routes were barely &quot;viable&quot; to begin with.  The early underground voyage survival rates were abysmal.  

Bone Fractures.  Hypothermia.  Dehydration.  Psychosis.  Trapped by collapses.  So many ways to end up a colorfully dressed skeleton who&#39;s only remaining purpose is to serve as a waymarker for those attempting the same route.

Thankfully, the wastewater and ventillation systems were far too intricate to fully seal.  Hundreds of portals still exist only minimally secured.  

So, sewer it is then.

[[So, dying of infection isn&#39;t an option?]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="p:I didn&#39;t exactly have much agency during that period of my life." tags="" position="2438,2074" size="100,100">As opposed to now?

You&#39;re a healthy human being, just slightly past its prime, but with all digits included.  Your purpose right now is finding out what happened to your Mom after you left her behind fleeing a ruined city.

Any questions?

[[p:No more questions. Everything is clear to me!  Take me to the waking world, I must return to the sewer.-&gt;Looking Up]]
