Entry 2.  July 3th.

Vera::Forgot to fill this in for the last few days but that&#39;s ok because they&#39;d not look any different from the initial entry.  The accounting here is hellishly monotonous.  Do you have any clue how difficult it is to bore someone passionate about accounting? 

Vera::Within the SATURN core I felt like I was actually making an impact at least.  I guess Rosalind was so &quot;thrilled&quot; I blew the whistle on the fraudulently produced safety test results that she decided I could make an even bigger impact here, making sure no screaming newborns double dip in the hospital account.

Vera::The only things of any import to keep track of are the medicine consumption tabulations and the infant sickness rates and correlations.  Sometimes more than one gets hepatitis, and there&#39;s a link.  Sometimes some fent fiend decides to dip into the medical supply closets.  Petty indiscrepancies.  It&#39;s not much but it&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to work with.

That name.  There it is.  Your heart rate spikes, and your passages dilate.  The hairs on your neck and arms are put on full alert.  A strong response to such a simple phonetic construct.

Ferryman::Hey, &quot;Rosalind&quot; is your Mom&#39;s name, right? 

[[Yes.  It is.]]
[[p:(Action) Nod silently.-&gt;Yes.  It is.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Page 1" tags="page1" position="958,296" size="100,100">Vera::Mood diary.  Entry 1.  June 27th.

Vera::Feel bad.  Difficulty getting up in the morning.  Unappetized at lunch.  Foggy in the afternoon.  Strong undercurrent of malaise all day.

Vera::I would have written the same on days minus-14 to 0 if I started this earlier.

Vera::Getting &quot;promoted&quot; to the maternity ward.  What an infuriating euphemism.  The pay is the same, the work is even less important, and I&#39;m surrounded by screaming newborns.  I hate children!  Famously!  Sending me here was a sick joke.

Vera::Perhaps if I&#39;m as obnoxious in this position in the last, I can get &quot;promoted&quot; out of here yet again...

Ferryman::Seems as though &quot;Vera&quot; was pretty unhappy to be transferred here.

[[p:(Action) Flip the page.-&gt;Page 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Untitled Passage" tags="" position="946,13" size="100,100">You find an encrusted, tattered notebook lying in the bottom-right drawer of the corner desk.  The name &quot;Vera Silkwood&quot; is scribbled on the cover.

Ferryman::Good find.  That notebook probably belonged to one of the accountants that worked here in the administration wing.  You might glean a few things about what went on around here by flipping through it.

[[This appears to be someone&#39;s diary.  Wouldn&#39;t that be a little invasive?]]

Wouldn&#39;t that be a little invasive?" tags="" position="811,165" size="100,100">Ferryman::Well, yes.  But whoever it belonged to is almost certainly dead.  I don&#39;t think anyone will mind.

Since when have privacy concerns been an impediment to you?

Open it.

[[p:Definitely a match.  She was in charge of staff rotation and transfer, amongst other duties.]]
[[p:It&#39;s her.  I just know, somehow.-&gt;p:Definitely a match.  She was in charge of staff rotation and transfer, amongst other duties.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="p:Definitely a match.  She was in charge of staff rotation and transfer, amongst other duties." tags="" position="947,827" size="100,100">Ferryman::Hmm.  I see.  In that case we should definitely keep reading.

Ferryman::...Oh, what&#39;s this?  It seems the rest of the pages have been ripped out.  I wonder why...

Ferryman::Let&#39;s keep an eye out for the remaining pages as we explore the rest of the accounting block.  We might glean a bit more information about Rosalind, if we happen across them.

You&#39;ve got to find those pages.  Time to invoke bloodhound mode.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
