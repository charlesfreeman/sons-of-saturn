Julia&#39;s room.  

The hairs on the back of your neck transform into spikes.  Your tongue intercepts a mild metallic tinge.

[[p:(Action) Unlock the door]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="p:(Action) Unlock the door" tags="" position="1179,756" size="100,100">You open the door to find Julia sitting on her bed, silently, drooped over.

She isn&#39;t reading.  She isn&#39;t praying.

[[Continue-&gt;Head raise.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Head raise." tags="" position="1179,906" size="100,100">She looks up to see who is intruding.

Julia::What are you doing here?  You shouldn&#39;t be here.  

She does not look frightful anymore.  She looks pitiful.

[[Continue-&gt;Gets up]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Gets up" tags="" position="1179,1056" size="100,100">Julia rises to apprehend you, seemingly more out of a sense of obligation than genuine spite.

[[p:(Action) Show her the shoes.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="p:(Action) Show her the shoes." tags="" position="1179,1206" size="100,100">Julia glances at the shoes in your outstretched hand and halts her advance.

Julia::What are these?  Why are you showing me these?

[[p:Cut the shit.  You know what they are.]]
[[p:They&#39;re Thomas&#39; shoes.  Your dead child&#39;s shoes.-&gt;p:Cut the shit.  You know what they are.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="p:Cut the shit.  You know what they are." tags="" position="1175,1359" size="100,100">There is a mood shift.  Julia aquiesces, and gently takes the shoes from your hands.

She almost seems calm, only her subtle trembling and deliberate breath revealing great tension.

Julia::Where did you get these?

[[p:That doesn&#39;t matter.  What matters is that you acknowledge the truth.]]
[[p:I found them in your room, along with a document stating that your son had died in state custody.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="p:That doesn&#39;t matter.  What matters is that you acknowledge the truth." tags="" position="1100,1509" size="100,100">She doesn&#39;t seem to hear you.  The shoes have taken her captive.

Just as suddenly, another shift.

[[Continue-&gt;Throw shoes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="p:I found them in your room, along with a document stating that your son had died in state custody." tags="" position="1250,1509" size="100,100">Julia::I...see.

She continues staring at the shoes, as though they ought to be revered.

[[Continue-&gt;Throw shoes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Throw shoes" tags="" position="1172,1665" size="100,100">Julia violently throws the shoes at you.  They hit your stomach and bounce onto the floor.

She is sobbing now.

Julia::Please, take them away.  Stop.  Please.

Julia::Undo it.  It never was.  He never was.

Julia::Take the shoes away.

[[p:You loved Thomas, didn&#39;t you?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="p:You loved Thomas, didn&#39;t you?" tags="" position="1171,1815" size="100,100">Julia::Thomas destroyed my body.  Destroyed my career.  I resented him.  I resent him.

Julia::I never wanted him inside of me.  I never wanted a child.  I shouldn&#39;t have a child.  It wasn&#39;t my choice.  Take the shoes away.

[[p:You shouldn&#39;t have had to carry Thomas.  You weren&#39;t wrong to try and terminate the pregnancy.  But he wasn&#39;t at fault for being born.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="p:You shouldn&#39;t have had to carry Thomas.  You weren&#39;t wrong to try and terminate the pregnancy.  But he wasn&#39;t at fault for being born." tags="" position="1172,1965" size="100,100">Julia::The State was supposed to take care of him.  They said they would.  He cried and cried when they took him away but it was for his own good.

Julia::It&#39;s their fault I had to carry him in the first place.  Their fault I couldn&#39;t get rid of him.  

[[p:Then why are you here?  If you really feel so guilt free?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="p:Then why are you here?  If you really feel so guilt free?" tags="" position="1172,2115" size="100,100">Julia::Because...

Her posture collapses further.  She&#39;s a slumped puddle of a human being.

Julia::Because I knew he was going to die in State Custody.  I know what sort of experiments the Core runs on State Boys, in Rosalind&#39;s programs.

Another shift.  Her eyes light up with indignation.  She aims them at you.

Julia::Who are you to judge me?  What was I to do?  Pretend to love a child that I hated, that I wish never existed?  A child that shouldn&#39;t exist?

[[p:Maybe what happened to Thomas wasn&#39;t your fault.  But what about all the kids you helped Dr. Tann steal?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="p:Maybe what happened to Thomas wasn&#39;t your fault.  But what about all the kids you helped Dr. Tann steal?" tags="" position="1170,2265" size="100,100">Julia::Rosalind is doing important work in the Core.  She needs subjects.  The amount of human suffering she could alleviate if she pulls this off...

Julia::And we were doing those women a favor.  Do you know what kind of person ends up at this hospital?  They couldn&#39;t support another child.  

Julia::All of the pregnant women I treated had only convinced themselves they wanted their child because they had no other options.

[[p:Doesn&#39;t matter.  That wasn&#39;t you or Tann&#39;s choice to make.-&gt;p:Enough with the mental gymnastics.  At the end of the day, a lot of new mothers had their children stolen and likely killed because of your complicity.]]
[[p:Enough with the mental gymnastics.

At the end of the day, a lot of new mothers had their children stolen and likely killed because of your complicity." tags="" position="1247,2415" size="100,100">Julia heard you, but she is staring past you now.  She is quiet.  And solemn.  

Several agonizing moments of silence rise and fall.  Suddenly, violently, the tension is shatted, and Julia looks right at you.

Julia::There must be some way to undo it all.  Go back to the way things were before.

Julia::Tell me how to undo it.

[[p:You can&#39;t undo it.  You have to accept what happened.]]
[[p:Thomas is dead.  So are all those other kids, probably.  They can&#39;t forgive you.-&gt;p:You can&#39;t undo it.  You have to accept what happened.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="p:You can&#39;t undo it.  You have to accept what happened." tags="" position="1258,2564" size="100,100">Jane::That&#39;s it then?  My past actions will stand there, in the past, uncorrectable, for all eternity.

Jane::Nothing I can do will ever change it.

[[p:It&#39;s too late to correct the damage, even partially.  You can&#39;t even ask for forgiveness at this point.  All you can do now is acknowledge the pain you&#39;ve inflicted.]]
[[p:The past is washed away by the present.  It only continues to linger because you haven&#39;t accepted your guilt.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="p:It&#39;s too late to correct the damage, even partially.  You can&#39;t even ask for forgiveness at this point.  All you can do now is acknowledge the pain you&#39;ve inflicted." tags="" position="1180,2719" size="100,100">Julia::So all those mothers who went to their graves hating me, there&#39;s nothing I can do?  All I can do is &quot;move on?&quot;

[[C-&gt;Moving on]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="p:The past is washed away by the present.  It only continues to linger because you haven&#39;t accepted your guilt." tags="" position="1358,2718" size="100,100">Julia::It hasn&#39;t been washed away.  I still feel it.  I feel the pain I caused.  I feel the hate and anguish that those mothers took to their grave.

[[C-&gt;Moving on]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Moving on" tags="" position="1262,2894" size="100,100">Julia::Everyone just tells you to move on, but no one ever actually tells you how to fucking do that.  I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.  I won&#39;t stop thinking about it.

Julia::I don&#39;t want to forgive myself.  I don&#39;t deserve my own forgiveness.

[[p:No one deserves it.  We&#39;re all tarnished.  But perpetual self flagellation won&#39;t correct any damage.]]
