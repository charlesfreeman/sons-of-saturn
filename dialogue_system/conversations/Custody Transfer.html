Note::This document certifies that one Thomas Melnik is now a ward of the Saturn Interior Ministry.  This will be our final communication barring further requests for information.  

Note::Subject: Thomas Melnic

Note::Producer: Julia Melnic

Note::Recipient: SATURN I.M.

[[p:So, Julia put Thomas up for adoption?]]
[[p:Guess Julia didn&#39;t love her kid very much.  I can respect that.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Untitled Passage 1" tags="" position="739,368" size="100,100">You scan the suitcases along the wall for familiar names.

Andrew.  Sheldon.  Daniels.  All misses.

Finally, a sense of familiarity occupies your periphery.  Julia.

[[p:(Action) Search the suitcase.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="p:(Action) Search the suitcase." tags="" position="738,503" size="100,100">The suitcase is stuffed with old documents - contracts, checks, and receipts.  

One in particular catches you eye: a notice of custody transfer.

Wiggly::They take in indigent children, teach them vocational skills, provide some employment.

Wiggly::Really kind of them, to look after kids in Thomas&#39;s position.

[[p:Just like they were &quot;kind&quot; to you, right?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="p:Guess Julia didn&#39;t love her kid very much.  I can respect that." tags="" position="812,785" size="100,100">Wiggly::I, uh, would like to think her feelings were more complicated.  But perhaps.

Wiggly::He would have been well off in the care of the SATURN Interior Ministry.

Wiggly::They take in indigent children, teach them vocational skills, provide some employment, eventually.

Wiggly::Really kind of them, to look after kids in Thomas&#39;s position.

[[p:Just like they were &quot;kind&quot; to you, right?]]
[[p:Yes, very &quot;kind&quot; of them.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="p:Just like they were &quot;kind&quot; to you, right?" tags="" position="662,935" size="100,100">Wiggly::Yeah, exactly!  Such good people.

Wiggly::But I was in a totally different program than the one Thomas got put into.  He probably just got put in charge of telegrammatic upkeep or something, closer to the core.

He&#39;s a grown man with the psychological profile of a puppy.

Wiggly::Hey, what&#39;s that on the back of the notice?  Looks like a note of some sort

[[p:(Action) Check the back of the notice.-&gt;Page 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Page 2" tags="page2" position="728,1104" size="100,100">Note::Postscript:

Note::I don&#39;t often include personal notes with these notices but these are unique circumstances.  Most women who put a child in our program don&#39;t live two floors above in the same building.  

Note::Furthermore, some of my colleagues have expressed concerns that living in such close proximity to your former child might cause psychological duress.  Be informed that while we permit visitation, we don&#39;t encourage it, and two days prior notice is required in all cases.

Note::Rosalind, Program Director.

There it is again.

Wiggly::That&#39;s your Mom again, right?  So I guess Thomas wasn&#39;t sent to the Interior.

[[p:No, he was sent downstairs.  To Mom.]]
[[p:Thomas ended up in Mom&#39;s program.  Do you think that&#39;s why Julia clung to me?]]  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="p:Yes, very &quot;kind&quot; of them." tags="" position="813,935" size="100,100">Wiggly nods in agreement.  He seems to have not picked up on the sarcastic intonations.

He takes everything at face value, doesn&#39;t he?

Wiggly::Hey, what&#39;s that on the back of the notice?  Looks like a note of some sort.

Wiggly::I&#39;m not sure we know enough to say for sure, though.  And I&#39;m not sure that lead is going to be very helpful for shaking Julia off, either.
