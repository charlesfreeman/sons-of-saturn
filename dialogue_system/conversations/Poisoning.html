Julia::Miss?  Miss!

Julia is behind you.  She followed you all the way down the hall.

Julia::Miss, slow down!  You&#39;re medicated, you shouldn&#39;t be walking without assistance!

[[Continue-&gt;Not Alright]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Not Alright" tags="closer" position="1177,763" size="100,100">Do not stop, do not wait for her.  Where is Wiggly?  Try to find Wiggly.  He should be here.  You are not alright.

Hildegardian distortions are afflicting your visual field, and an aching tension has colonized your jaw.  Furthermore, an unmistakably metallic taste is blistering your tongue.

What&#39;s more, standing without falling over now requires your active attention.  Your proprioceptive competencies have been reduced to goop - standing is now a &quot;manual mode&quot; activity.  

You are losing your balance, quickly.  

[[p:(Action) Find something to grab and regain balance.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="p:(Action) Find something to grab and regain balance." tags="" position="1177,913" size="100,100">You flail your hands wildly, groping haphazardly for an anchor.  Your right hand lands first, finding a handle on the nearby medical cabinet.

The cabinet is your only source of stability.  You put all your weight on it, trying to balance.

It&#39;s not as heavy as you imagined.  You can feel it tipping towards you.  There&#39;s no stopping it.

[[p:(Action) Dodge out of the way.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="p:(Action) Dodge out of the way." tags="fall" position="1175,1062" size="100,100">You flail forwards towards the back of the room, mostly clear of the falling cabinet, but your legs end up pinned underneath.  

A mutlicolored assortment of vials, syringes, and ampoules flow forth from the cabinet.  They stain the floor you&#39;re pinned to.

Not a moment later, you hear clanging footsteps.  Julia is closing the distance.  

[[Continue-&gt;Restraint]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Restraint" tags="" position="1177,1213" size="100,100">Julia enters the room, jams her knee between your shoulderblades, and arrests your left wrist, pulling it behind your back.  Her skin feels like ice.  

The distortions intensify the moment her skin touches yours.  

She&#39;s restraining you, and she&#39;s poisoning you.

[[p:Hey!  Let me go!]]
[[p:Julia, what are you doing?!?-&gt;p:Hey!  Let me go!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="p:Hey!  Let me go!" tags="" position="1178,1364" size="100,100">Julia::The patient is behaving violently, initiating restrainment procedures.

Julia is shouting down the hall.  She pretends not to hear you.

You struggle, but Julia has a stranglehold on your left wrist, and her knee on your back.  

Your legs remain pinned by the medical cabinet, though you can tell it isn&#39;t too heavy.  

Only your right arm remains emancipated.  Use it!

[[(Action) Grab a syringe-tipped ampoule and stab Julia.]]
[[(Action) Look at the needle.]]
[[0,1:I thought you weren&#39;t supposed to share needles.]]
[[1,p:(Action) Stab yourself with the hypodermic needle.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="(Action) Grab a syringe-tipped ampoule and stab Julia." tags="" position="922,1542" size="100,100">You sieze the needle and violently strike Julia&#39;s right thigh.  You penetrate her envelope, breaking her epidermis, causing an electric shock to shiver down your spine.  You shake off the intrusions.

Julia doesn&#39;t react to the invasion in any way.  She isn&#39;t even trying to prevent a second strike.  She finds it familiar.

The room begins to reek of organic solvents.  Your shoulder blades and left wrist start to rot.

[[Continue-&gt;p:Hey!  Let me go!]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="(Action) Look at the needle." tags="" position="1084,1546" size="100,100">You drag the vial into your field of view.  You can make out the label now.  The needle contains a dose of norepinephrine.

Inject it!  Straight into the mainline.  This should still be intuitive for you.

Use the boost to wrestle out of Julia&#39;s grip.

[[Continue-&gt;p:Hey!  Let me go!]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="1,p:(Action) Stab yourself with the hypodermic needle." tags="chair" position="1439,1546" size="100,100">You haphazardly plunge the needle into the outer side of your right thigh, midway between your hip and knee.  The sting of violent self-penetration reverberates through your leg.

Julia::...Aaahg!...

Julia releases her grip and throws herself back.  You failed to navigate the norepinephrine to a viable vein, but stabbing yourself has thrown Julia off balance.  

[[p:(Action) Free yourself.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="0,1:I thought you weren&#39;t supposed to share needles." tags="" position="1263,1546" size="100,100">You aren&#39;t, but you&#39;ve got more pressing concerns.  Rot takes 40 years to kill you these days.

[[Continue-&gt;p:Hey!  Let me go!]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="p:(Action) Free yourself." tags="" position="1438,1696" size="100,100">You pull your legs out from under the cabinet, and coil yourself into a pouncing position.  You need to get up and make a run for it.

You notice your left hand is covered in blood.

[[p:(Action) Stan up, turn around, and run for it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="p:(Action) Stan up, turn around, and run for it." tags="" position="1437,1826" size="100,100">You press your chest up and tuck in your knees, quickly but deliberately putting your weight on your right foot.  You begin to push your center of mass up.

[[Continue-&gt;Standing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Standing" tags="window" position="1432,1956" size="100,100">Your balance fades slightly as your right leg nears full extension.  You slam your left leg firmly into the liquid floor, stabilizing yourself.

Both legs are fully extended now.  You&#39;re doing it.  You&#39;re standing.

[[p:Turn around.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="p:Turn around." tags="corner" position="1417,2092" size="100,100">Julia has retreated to the corner, hyperventillating.  

[[C-&gt;Shut door]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="p:(Action) Run out the door." tags="" position="1644,4003" size="100,100">You still haven&#39;t fully regained the capacity to coordinate your muscles.  You ramble through the door, clumsily but successfully.

Fuck, which way do you go?  Left or right?

[[p:Left.]]
[[p:Right.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="p:Right." tags="" position="1439,4016" size="100,100">Yeah, right has been going well for us lately.  Had to use your right arm for stabbing, grabbing, and all that.  And by god it got the job done.

Now, run, no, ramble down the hallway!

[[p:(Action) Ramble down the hallway.-&gt;Ramble]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Nearly There" tags="" position="1559,3999" size="100,100">You&#39;ve made it into the Foyer.  You hear footsteps following you.  Look for a place to hide!

[[(Action) Look Left.]]
[[(Action) Look Down.]]
[[(Action) Look Right.]]
[[2,p:(Action) Follow Wigley into the tunnels.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="(Action) Look Right." tags="" position="1642,3876" size="100,100">On the right, you see-

Hey, look.  That&#39;s Wigley!

Wigley::This way.

Wisely, he speaks in a subdued tone.  He must know someone is after you.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="2,p:(Action) Follow Wigley into the tunnels." tags="" position="1764,3731" size="100,100">You propel yourself to the tunnel entrance, and ungangly, yet awe inspiring and majestic sight.

[[Continue-&gt;Looking Down Hatch]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Looking Down Hatch" tags="" position="1764,3880" size="100,100">As you approach the hatch Wigley begins descending the ladder.  Follow his lead.

[[p:(Action) Descend.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="p:(Action) Descend." tags="" position="1764,4030" size="100,100">Getting your right foot onto the top rung goes smoothly enough, but getting the left on proves tricky.  You miss the next rung, and feel your foot unexpectedly hit the one beneath.  You lose grip and fall back.

[[Continue-&gt;Fall]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Fall" tags="" position="1764,4180" size="100,100">You fall about six feet, onto your back.  You bring Wigley down with you.  You lay back, staring up at the open hatch.

[[Wiggly, close the hatch.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Wiggly, close the hatch." tags="" position="1764,4330" size="100,100">Wiggly shakes himself out of his shock, then processes your command.  He seems to understand.  He collects himself and hurries to the top of the ladder.  You can sense light footsteps inducing vibrations in the dust above, causing minute amounts of insulation to fall onto your face.

Wiggly makes it to the top of the ladder and closes the latch, locking it as he does so.  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="p:(Action) Open the door." tags="" position="1286,2283" size="100,100">The door is locked now.  You violently shake the handle.  It&#39;s as if the door is glued into its frame.

It&#39;s just like the isolation cell door that seperated you from Wiggly.

The Cradle wants you here.

You feel an icy tug on your right leg.

[[C-&gt;Look down]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="p:(Action) Approach Julia." tags="corner" position="1535,2322" size="100,100">Julia is huddled in the corner, whimpering.  Her body is lightly convulsing, as if she were being electrocuted.

She is pathetic.

[[p:What did you inject me with?  Why did you pin me to the ground?]]
[[p:(Action) Kick Julia.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="p:What did you inject me with?  Why did you pin me to the ground?" tags="" position="1432,2475" size="100,100">Julia doesn&#39;t respond.  Instead, she falls forward, onto your feet.

Then, she begins to climb your leg.  Her fingers delve through your cloth, into your skin.

[[C-&gt;Julia looks up]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="p:(Action) Kick Julia." tags="" position="1602,2473" size="100,100">You swing your right leg into Julia, but she intercepts the blow.  

She latches onto your leg.  Her fingers delve through your cloth, into your skin.

[[C-&gt;Julia looks up]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Julia looks up" tags="" position="1516,2607" size="100,100">DEMO NOTE:  Julia looks up at you with gouged out eyes at this point.  Felt I should mention this for the sake of clarity. - Charles

Julia::Help me out of this.  Give me the sedatives, miss.  You should be so grateful I gave them to you.

Julia::Please, Miss, I am in pain.  You don&#39;t know what this feels like.

[[p:(Action) Try to tug away.]]
[[p:(Action) Strike Julia.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="p:(Action) Try to tug away." tags="" position="1437,2753" size="100,100">Julia::Miss, no, please don&#39;t leave me like this.  Please not here, not in this room!

Julia::Leave me alone, anywhere else!

Her fingers sink deeper.  Your calf begins to sear.

[[p:(Action) Try to break free.]]
[[p:(Action) Kiss Julia.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="p:(Action) Strike Julia." tags="" position="1587,2753" size="100,100">Her contorted body is like a bag of ice.  Every blow is absorbed and ignored.

Julia::Please, Miss, just help me.  Help me out of it.

Her fingers sink deeper.  Your calf begins to sear.

[[p:(Action) Try to break free.]]
[[p:(Action) Kiss Julia.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="p:(Action) Try to break free." tags="" position="1577,2918" size="100,100">You put your hands around Julia&#39;s neck and squeeze.  Violently you push her away.

Julia sheepishly shrinks back into the corner.  She begins shaking again.

[[-&gt;Hands]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="p:(Action) Kiss Julia." tags="" position="1414,2912" size="100,100">You cave to the intrusions.  You bend down and press your lips against Julia&#39;s.  You move your right hand down her chest.

You feel a pleasant shock, ringing through your jaw.  Sensations you&#39;ve never felt, never knew to desire.

For a moment, the contact feels radiant, and beautiful.

But the radiance soon gives way to heat.  Burning, painful heat.

Your lips inflame.  Your hand recoils.  Bullet ants begin swarming your body.

The pain is so far along the horseshoe, you aren&#39;t sure if it&#39;s fire or frostbite.

[[C-&gt;Recoil]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Hands" tags="" position="1557,3056" size="100,100">She raises her hands to her face.

Julia::Why?  Why do I still see these?

Your own hands begin to burn.  Violently.

The sensation spreads.  Bullet ants begin swarming your body.

The pain is so far along the horseshoe, you aren&#39;t sure if it&#39;s fire or frostbite.

[[C-&gt;Recoil]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Recoil" tags="ceiling" position="1415,3062" size="100,100">You recoil, lose balance, and land flat on your back.

The ceiling is trying to suck you in.  It&#39;s succeeding.

Your legs and arms extend, retract, taking on bizarre proportions.  

You feel like a triangle with paradoxical edge lengths.  You shouldn&#39;t exist.

Why do I keep finding you like this?

[[p:(Action) Soak in the sights and just vibe.]]
[[p:(Action) Try to regain composure.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="p:(Action) Soak in the sights and just vibe." tags="" position="1340,3181" size="100,100">This maneuver has never, ever worked for you in the past.  But sure, let&#39;s try again.

Let&#39;s just assess how this ceiling, and this body, feel.

The sights are horrific and the vibes are rancid.  This isn&#39;t going well.

[[C-&gt;Noise]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="p:(Action) Try to regain composure." tags="" position="1490,3182" size="100,100">Gaslight yourself.  Your legs and arms ARE the same length.  Proprioceptive senses lie.

The ceiling is just a normal ceiling, adorned with a cool pattern.  You can just see it more clearly now.

The nerve endings fraying along your appendages are merely toxins leaving the body.  You will come out of this healthy.

[[C-&gt;Noise]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="Noise" tags="" position="1412,3316" size="100,100">Your fog is interuppted by an intrusive, grating sound.  The sound of a hatch opening?

[[C-&gt;Wiggly Arrives]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Wiggly Arrives" tags="hole" position="1412,3466" size="100,100">Wiggly::Amelie!  Climb in here!

He&#39;s opened the grate leading to the ducts for you.  Dive for it!

[[p:(Action) Dive into the aperature.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="p:(Action) Dive into the aperature." tags="" position="1412,3616" size="100,100">You hurl yourself into a horrible configuration some would call &quot;upright.&quot;

You launch yourself into the hole.

She is pathetic.
