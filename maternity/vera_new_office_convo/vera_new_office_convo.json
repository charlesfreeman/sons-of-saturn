July 14th\n\nVera::Missed a few days again, though this time only because I'm so wrapped up in my work.\n\nVera::I've discovered that instances of infant mortality and stillbirth are synchronized with the medical supply irregularities I documented.  Every cluster of stillbirths is preceded by a suspicious reduction in the quantities of ergot and datura we have on hand.  \n\nVera::The implications of this are...chilling.  I think someone is using the ergot to induce stillbirths.  That would explain why the stillbirths tend to occur in clusters, and why the medical supplies always go missing at the same time.  I'm going to try and get my hands on more precise staff time sheets, ideally with hourly precision.  Maybe there's a pattern I didn't see before.\n\nVera::Oh, yeah, mood positive.  Driven.\n\n[[p:She thinks someone is swiping the ergot and using it to induce abortions?]]\n[[p:This lady is obsessive.  No wonder that administrator didn't want her around.]]",

The pattern: over 90% of the incidents of \"stillbirth\" occurred under the direct watch of Dr. Tann or one of his nurses.  I suspect they are using ergot from the medical supply closet to induce miscarriage (though I'm uncertain of datura's utility).  Some of the necessary medical equipment is only accessible intermittently, thus explaining the clustering.  \n\nVera::Dr. Tann's team has two women booked for visitation tomorrow morning, both for obviously frivolous afflictions.  I'm going to surveil one of their operations.  If they perform professionally, I'll probably just keep my mouth shut.  They're probably just a discreet team providing a necessary service.\n\nVera::But I need proof.  There's a ventilation grate in the room they are slated to use.  I'll spy from the ducts and see how they perform.\n\n[[p:So, Dr. Tann was running an underground abortion ring?]]\n[[p:No wonder Tann didn't want Vera here...]]",
