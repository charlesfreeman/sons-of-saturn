Before you is some sort of medical table.

Ferryman::Careful, stand clear.

He lets down the hatch in the corner very deliberately, as though to avoid making much noise.

Ferryman::We are in the hospital&#39;s mortuary.  If you take a peak through the doorframe to your left you&#39;ll see the morgue

[[(Action) Take a peak.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="0:Why do they have a morgue?  I thought this was an infirmary." tags="" position="786,577" size="100,100">Sadly, in the era the infirmary was active, death during childbirth was depressingly common.  The medical professionals here were top of the line, certainly, but they were still constrained by the limited medical knowledge available to them.

That seems excessive." tags="" position="935,576" size="100,100">This infirmary was a large facility, so a correspondingly large morgue was needed.  We could probably find accounting records pertaining to patient population and deaths somewhere in the infirmary complex, if you are truly curious.

The Cradle usually responds more mercifully when the client takes the lead.  I&#39;m honestly less of a &quot;guide&quot;, and more of a &quot;sherpa.&quot; 

That said...I do have a few suggestions.  You&#39;re here looking for your Mom, correct?  Well, we&#39;re right below the administrative section of the infirmary.  There&#39;s a flight of stairs right outside the door behind you - they&#39;ll take you right up.

We aren&#39;t likely to find exactly what you are looking for there.  We&#39;re probably going to need to pay a visit to operations ward or perhaps the chronic ward to find exactly what you are looking for.  But we&#39;ll probably find enough info here to better narrow down our search.  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="(Action) Take a peak." tags="morgue" position="633,764" size="100,100">You peak around the corner and are greeted by an enormous, 18 body morgue.  The apparatus appears mostly intact, though a few of the doors have been wrestled from their hinges.  Even though this facility was shuttered years ago, you can perceive a faint whiff of Formaldehyde that continues to cling to the air.
