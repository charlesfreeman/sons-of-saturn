The corpse of a snake that bit itself in half.  The whale corpse washed up and exploded, and all the rotten bits are rocketing through the air and crushing bystanders.  

Some have declared this land a noble failure.  Man would have been foolish to not attempt to harness it.  The consequences were unforseeable.

Others have argued that the grand experiment was unwise from the start.  The Death and Suffering, the land that was forever ruined, never to be rehabilitated.  They weren&#39;t tragedies, they were crimes, perpetrated by capitalists and opportunists that should have known better.

You don&#39;t care either way.  You&#39;re here for something more personal.

He stops mid sentences.

Wigley::Oh.  Oh no.

Wigley::Miss, I have bad news.  The hatch has been welded shut.  We cannot access the basement.

Wigley::But somehow I am not shocked.  The Cradle has been reacting...antagonistically towards you.  More so than any other client I have ever shepherded.  

[[You&#39;re saying that the Cradle itself sealed this hatch?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="p:Are there no other routes to the basement?" tags="" position="1340,912.5" size="100,100">Wigley::No, I am afraid there are not.  Every basement level door was welded shut long ago, well before the Cradle was even abandoned.  Even the utility tunnel connections were blocked off.  They only neglected to seal the basement elevator entrance because they had reprogrammed the elevator to never go there.

[[They really wanted to keep people out, huh?]]
[[(Action) Take a look at in the elevator equipment shed.]]

It could be complex reverb phenomena.  Perhaps it&#39;s just another Ferryman expedition that decided to seal it.  I am really uncertain.

And the oddities started before the infirmary even closed, though not long before.  

I don&#39;t like going there.  I only suggested we investigate it out of desperation.

Once this line is cut, and the break is released, nothing will serve to retard the elevator&#39;s free-fall.

Wigley::The elevator is idling on the second floor and needs to make it all the way down to the basement.  That&#39;s nearly a ten meter drop.  

[[We don&#39;t have any other choice.]]
[[I&#39;ve heard that if you jump right before the elevator hits the ground, you&#39;ll be uninjured.]]

I know you put forth and enormous degree of planning and effort into this expedition but please do not feel as though you haven&#39;t the option to turn back.

How thick is this guy?  You don&#39;t have a choice.

If you are hurdling towards the ground at 20 meters per second, and jump up at a speed of 1 meter per second, well...

Wigley::You&#39;ll hit the ground at 19 meters per second.

You knew all of that, but were hoping it might convince him to go along with this plan.  Unfortunately he knew better.

And I have a few tools in my bag we could use to detach and reattach the hoist cable.  But what would we use as the counterweight?

[[p:How about that rooftop air conditioning unit?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="p:How about that rooftop air conditioning unit?" tags="" position="1781,1525.5" size="100,100">Wigley::Hmm.  I suppose that would be about the right weight - probably slightly less heavy that the elevator cabin.  And it would be easy to affix the hoist cable to it and shove it off the roof.

Wigley::Honestly, I think this might work.  But it is still an enormously dangerous plan, Miss.  I cannot recommend it in good conscience.

Wigley::Alright.

Wigley::Alright, miss.  Everything is in position.  When you are ready, go to the floor below and enter the elevator cabin.  Smack hard on the roof of the cabin when you&#39;re ready for me to release the lever.

Wigley::I&#39;ll try and reconvene with you in the Nurses Quarters.  Some of the basement level entrances should be barred from within, so you should be able to let me in.

Wigley::Be overwhelmingly careful down there, Miss.  The Nurses Quarters are blocked off for a reason.
